When grid items are positioned outside of these bounds, the grid container generates implicit grid tracks by adding implicit grid lines to the grid. These lines together with the explicit grid form <strong>the implicit grid</strong>.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>So, in plain English, the browser auto-generates extra rows and columns in case any elements happen to be placed outside the defined grid.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>What about auto-placement?</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Similar to the concept of implicit grid, <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-1/#common-uses-auto-placement\" rel=\"noopener\">auto-placement</a> is the ability of the browser to automatically place the items inside the grid. We don’t always need to give the position of each item.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through different use cases, we are going to see how such features can help us create complex and dynamic grid with a few lines of code.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"dynamic-sidebar\">Dynamic sidebar</h3>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_NWYPpEB/0717adced0f44e076f3936f35cde0650\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/NWYPpEB/0717adced0f44e076f3936f35cde0650?height=650&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=NWYPpEB/0717adced0f44e076f3936f35cde0650&amp;default-tab=result\" height=\"650\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed NWYPpEB/0717adced0f44e076f3936f35cde0650\" title=\"CodePen Embed NWYPpEB/0717adced0f44e076f3936f35cde0650\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, we have three different layouts but we only have one grid configuration that works for all of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">main {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: 1fr;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Only one column is taking up all the free space.

In fact, any other grid item we decide to throw in there at any time will now flow in a column direction, each one placed in its own implicit grid tracks. Perfect for situations where the number of items in the grid isn’t known in advance!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, we do still need <code>grid-column-end</code> if we want to place it in a column to the left of it because, otherwise, the <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> will occupy the explicit column which, in turn, pushes the <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> outside the explicit grid and forces it to take the implicit column.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know, I know. That’s a little convoluted. Here is another example we can use to better understand this little quirk:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_bGvNxNW/54fd420773f2335f049210994a4f5360\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/bGvNxNW/54fd420773f2335f049210994a4f5360?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=bGvNxNW/54fd420773f2335f049210994a4f5360&amp;default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed bGvNxNW/54fd420773f2335f049210994a4f5360\" title=\"CodePen Embed bGvNxNW/54fd420773f2335f049210994a4f5360\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In the first example, we didn’t specify any placement. In this case, the browser will first place the <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> element in the explicit column since it comes first in the DOM. The <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, meanwhile, is automatically placed in the grid column the browser automatically (or implicitly) creates for us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the second example, we set the <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> element outside of the explicit grid:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">aside {\n  grid-column-end: -2;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Now it doesn’t matter that <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> comes first in the HTML.

But guess what? I am not defining any grid at all! All I am doing is this:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.grid img:first-child {\n  grid-area: span 3 / span 3;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s surprising we only need one line of code to pull off something like this, so let’s dissect what’s going on and you will see that it’s easier than you may think. First of all, <code>grid-area</code> is a shorthand property that combines the following properties into a single declaration:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><code>grid-row-start</code></li><li><code>grid-row-end</code></li><li><code>grid-column-start</code></li><li><code>grid-column-end</code></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Wait! Isn’t <code>grid-area</code> the property we use to define <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/simple-named-grid-areas/\">named areas</a> instead of where elements start and end on the grid?</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, but it also does more. We could write a whole lot more about <code>grid-area</code>, but in this particular case:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.grid img:first-child {\n  grid-area: span 3 / span 3;\n}\n\n/* ...is equivalent to: */\n.grid img:first-child {\n  grid-row-start: span 3;\n  grid-column-start: span 3;\n  grid-row-end: auto;\n  grid-column-end: auto;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>We can see the same thing when cracking open DevTools to expand the shorthand version:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"215\" height=\"109\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/s_F4C924AEFDB642C9861B01422787157264225531682D164A8C42B48A83B84E89_1656628320609_image.png?resize=215%2C109&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-367182\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This means that the first image element in the grid needs to span <strong>three columns</strong> and <strong>three rows</strong>.

The browser set those columns and rows up for us. As a result, <strong>the remaining images in the HTML flow right into place using the same three columns and rows</strong>. And since the first image takes up all three columns in the first row, the remaining images flow into additional rows that each contain three columns, where each image takes up a single column.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All this from one line of CSS! That’s the power of “implicit” grid” and auto-placement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the second grid configuration in that demo, all I’ve done is change the automatic flow direction using <code>grid-auto-flow: column</code> the same way we did earlier when placing an <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> element next to a <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>. This forces the browser to create a <em>fourth</em> column it can use to place the remaining images. And since we have three rows, the remaining images get placed inside the same vertical column.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"660\" height=\"289\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/s_F4C924AEFDB642C9861B01422787157264225531682D164A8C42B48A83B84E89_1656628884092_image.png?resize=660%2C289&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-367185\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/s_F4C924AEFDB642C9861B01422787157264225531682D164A8C42B48A83B84E89_1656628884092_image.png?w=660&amp;ssl=1 660w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/s_F4C924AEFDB642C9861B01422787157264225531682D164A8C42B48A83B84E89_1656628884092_image.png?resize=300%2C131&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We need to add a few properties to the images to make sure they fit nicely inside the grid without any overflow:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.grid {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-gap: 10px;\n}\n\n/* for the second grid configuration */\n.horizontal {\n  grid-auto-flow: column;\n}\n\n/* The large 3⨉3 image */\n.grid img:first-child {\n  grid-area: span 3 / span 3;\n}\n\n/* Help prevent stretched or distorted images */\nimg {\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100%;\n  object-fit: cover;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course, we can easily update the grid to consider more images by adjusting one value.

So, let’s look at using only four elements for now:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"608\" height=\"212\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/s_F4C924AEFDB642C9861B01422787157264225531682D164A8C42B48A83B84E89_1656668565317_image.png?resize=608%2C212&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-367186\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/s_F4C924AEFDB642C9861B01422787157264225531682D164A8C42B48A83B84E89_1656668565317_image.png?w=608&amp;ssl=1 608w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/s_F4C924AEFDB642C9861B01422787157264225531682D164A8C42B48A83B84E89_1656668565317_image.png?resize=300%2C105&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, let’s define the grid and set up the general pattern using the <code>:nth-child</code> selector for alternating between elements:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.grid {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-auto-columns: 1fr; /* all the columns are equal */\n  grid-auto-rows: 100px; /* all the rows equal to 100px */\n}\n.grid :nth-child(4n + 1) { /* ?? */ }\n.grid :nth-child(4n + 2) { /* ?? */ }\n.grid :nth-child(4n + 3) { /* ?? */ }\n.grid :nth-child(4n + 4) { /* ?? */ }</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>We said that our pattern repeats every four elements, so we will logically use <code>4n + x</code> where <code>x</code> ranges from 1 to 4. It’s a little easier to explain the pattern this way:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-none\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">4(0) + 1 = 1 = 1st element /* we start with n = 0 */\n4(0) + 2 = 2 = 2nd element\n4(0) + 3 = 3 = 3rd element\n4(0) + 4 = 4 = 4th element\n4(1) + 1 = 5 = 5th element /* our pattern repeat here at n = 1 */\n4(1) + 2 = 6 = 6th element\n4(1) + 3 = 7 = 7th element\n4(1) + 4 = 8 = 8th element\n4(2) + 1 = 9 = 9th element /* our pattern repeat again here at n = 2 */\netc.</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Perfect, right? We have four elements, and repeat the pattern on the fifth element, the ninth element and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"is-style-explanation\">Those <code>:nth-child</code> selectors can be tricky! Chris has a super helpful <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/how-nth-child-works/\">explanation of how it all works</a>, including <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/useful-nth-child-recipies/\">recipes for creating different patterns</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now we configure each element so that:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>The first element needs to take two columns and start at column one (<code>grid-column: 1/span 2</code>).</li><li>The second element is placed in the third column (<code>grid-column-start: 3</code>).</li><li>The third element is placed at the first column: (<code>grid-column-start: 1</code>).</li><li>The fourth element takes two columns and starts at the second column: (<code>grid-column: 2/span 2</code>).</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Here that is in CSS:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.grid {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-auto-columns: 1fr; /* all the columns are equal */\n  grid-auto-rows: 100px; /* all the rows are equal to 100px */\n}\n.grid :nth-child(4n + 1) { grid-column: 1/span 2; }\n.grid :nth-child(4n + 2) { grid-column-start: 3; }\n.grid :nth-child(4n + 3) { grid-column-start: 1; }\n.grid :nth-child(4n + 4) { grid-column: 2/span 2; }</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>We could stop here and be done… but we can do better! Specifically, we can remove some declarations and rely grid’s auto-placement powers to do the job for us. This is the trickiest part to grok and requires a lot of practice to be able to identify what can be removed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing we can do is update <code>grid-column: 1 /span 2</code> and use only <code>grid-column: span 2</code> since, by default, the browser will place the first item into the first column. We can also remove this:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.grid :nth-child(4n + 3) { grid-column-start: 1; }</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>By placing the first, second, and fourth items, the grid automatically places the third item in the correct place. That means we’re left with this:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.grid {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-auto-rows: 100px; /* all the rows are equal to 100px */\n  grid-auto-columns: 1fr; /* all the columns are equal */\n}\n.grid :nth-child(4n + 1) { grid-column: span 2; }\n.grid :nth-child(4n + 2) { grid-column-start: 3; }\n.grid :nth-child(4n + 4) { grid-column: 2/span 2; }</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>But c’mon we can stroll do better! We can also remove this:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.grid :nth-child(4n + 2) { grid-column-start: 2; }</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Why? If we place the fourth element in the second column while allowing it to take up two full columns, we’re forcing the grid to create a third implicit column, giving us a total of three columns without explicitly telling it to. The fourth element cannot go into the first row since the first item is also taking two columns, so it flows to the next row. This configuration leave us with an empty column in the first row and an empty one in the second row.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"609\" height=\"212\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/s_F4C924AEFDB642C9861B01422787157264225531682D164A8C42B48A83B84E89_1656669552703_image.png?resize=609%2C212&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-367187\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/s_F4C924AEFDB642C9861B01422787157264225531682D164A8C42B48A83B84E89_1656669552703_image.png?w=609&amp;ssl=1 609w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/s_F4C924AEFDB642C9861B01422787157264225531682D164A8C42B48A83B84E89_1656669552703_image.png?resize=300%2C104&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I think you know the end of the story. The browser will automatically place the second and third items in those empty spots. So our code becomes even simpler:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.grid {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-auto-columns: 1fr; /* all the columns are equal */\n  grid-auto-rows: 100px; /* all the rows are equal to 100px */\n}\n.grid :nth-child(4n + 1) { grid-column: span 2; }\n.grid :nth-child(4n + 4) { grid-column: 2/span 2; }</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>All it takes is five declarations to create a very cool and very flexible pattern. The optimization part may be tricky, but you get used to it and gain some tricks with practice.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Why not use <code>grid-template-columns</code> to define explicit columns since we know the number of columns?</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>We can do that! Here’s the code for it:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.grid {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); /* all the columns are equal */\n  grid-auto-rows: 100px; /* all the rows are equal to 100px */\n}\n.grid :nth-child(4n + 1),\n.grid :nth-child(4n + 4) {\n  grid-column: span 2;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_ExEazLZ/73bf8a38c32f834321ea9e63510e23c9\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/ExEazLZ/73bf8a38c32f834321ea9e63510e23c9?height=750&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=ExEazLZ/73bf8a38c32f834321ea9e63510e23c9&amp;default-tab=result\" height=\"750\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed ExEazLZ/73bf8a38c32f834321ea9e63510e23c9\" title=\"CodePen Embed ExEazLZ/73bf8a38c32f834321ea9e63510e23c9\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see, the code is definitely more intuitive. We define three explicit grid columns and we tell the browser that the first and fourth elements need to take two columns. I highly recommend this approach! But the goal of this article is to explore new ideas and tricks that we get from CSS Grid’s implicit and auto-placement powers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The explicit approach is more straightforward, while an implicit grid requires you to — pardon the pun — fill in the gaps where CSS is doing additional work behind the scenes. In the end, I believe that having a solid understanding of implicit grids will help you better understand the CSS Grid algorithm. After all, we are not here to study what’s obvious — we are here to explore wild territories!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s try another pattern, a bit quicker this time:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_YzxaJom\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/YzxaJom?height=750&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=YzxaJom&amp;default-tab=result\" height=\"750\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed YzxaJom\" title=\"CodePen Embed YzxaJom\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Our pattern repeats every six elements. The third and fourth elements each need to occupy two full rows. If we place the third and the fourth elements, it seems that we don’t need to touch the others, so let’s try the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.grid {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-auto-columns: 1fr;\n  grid-auto-rows: 100px;\n}\n.grid :nth-child(6n + 3) {\n  grid-area: span 2/2; /* grid-row-start: span 2 &amp;&amp; grid-column-start: 2 */\n}\n.grid :nth-child(6n + 4) {\n  grid-area: span 2/1; /* grid-row-start: span 2 &amp;&amp; grid-column-start: 1 */\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_gOebJNq/bfb026fdd80549f4b5e1d72e6bdf5e13\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/gOebJNq/bfb026fdd80549f4b5e1d72e6bdf5e13?height=750&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=gOebJNq/bfb026fdd80549f4b5e1d72e6bdf5e13&amp;default-tab=result\" height=\"750\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed gOebJNq/bfb026fdd80549f4b5e1d72e6bdf5e13\" title=\"CodePen Embed gOebJNq/bfb026fdd80549f4b5e1d72e6bdf5e13\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Hmm, no good. We need to place the second element in the first column. Otherwise, the grid will automatically place it in the second column.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.grid :nth-child(6n + 2) {\n  grid-column: 1; /* grid-column-start: 1 */\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_BaryeXg/658adad08195ed95cd50e53de42494f2\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/BaryeXg/658adad08195ed95cd50e53de42494f2?height=750&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=BaryeXg/658adad08195ed95cd50e53de42494f2&amp;default-tab=result\" height=\"750\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed BaryeXg/658adad08195ed95cd50e53de42494f2\" title=\"CodePen Embed BaryeXg/658adad08195ed95cd50e53de42494f2\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Better, but there’s still more work, We need to shift the third element to the top. It’s tempting to try placing it in the first row this way:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.grid :nth-child(6n + 3) {\n  grid-area: 1/2/span 2; \n    /* Equivalent to:\n       grid-row-start: 1;\n       grid-row-end: span 2;\n       grid-column-start: 2 \n     */\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>But this doesn’t work because it forces all the <code>6n + 3</code> elements to get placed in the same area which makes a jumbled layout. The real solution is to keep the initial definition of the third element and add <code>grid-auto-flow: dense</code> to fill the gaps. <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-auto-flow\" rel=\"noopener\">From MDN</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>[The] &#8220;dense&#8221; packing algorithm attempts to fill <strong>in holes earlier in the grid</strong>, if smaller items come up later. This may cause items to appear out-of-order, when doing so would fill in holes left by larger items. If it is omitted, a &#8220;sparse&#8221; algorithm is used, where the placement algorithm only ever moves &#8220;forward&#8221; in the grid when placing items, never backtracking to fill holes. This ensures that all of the auto-placed items appear &#8220;in order&#8221;, even if this leaves holes that could have been filled by later items.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I know this property is not very intuitive but never forget it when you face a placement issue. Before trying different configurations in vain, add it because it may fix your layout with no additional effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Why not always add this property by default?</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t recommend it because, in some cases, we don’t want that behavior. Note how the MDN’s explanation there mentions it causes items to flow “out-of-order” to fill holes left by larger items. Visual order is usually just as important as the source order, particularly when it comes to accessible interfaces, and <code>grid-auto-flow: dense</code> can sometimes cause a mismatch between the visual and source order.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our final code is then:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.grid {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-auto-columns: 1fr;\n  grid-auto-flow: dense;\n  grid-auto-rows: 100px;\n}\n.grid :nth-child(6n + 2) { grid-column: 1; }\n.grid :nth-child(6n + 3) { grid-area: span 2/2; }\n.grid :nth-child(6n + 4) { grid-row: span 2; }</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Another one?

      "content_text": "When working with CSS Grid, the first thing to do is to set display: grid on the element that we want to be become a grid container. Then we explicitly define the grid using a combination of grid-template-columns, grid-template-rows, and grid-template-areas. And from there, the next step is to place items inside the grid.\n\n\n\nThis is the classic approach that should be used and I also recommend it. However, there is another approach for creating grids without any explicit definition. We call this the implicit grid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n“Explicit, implicit? What the heck is going on here?”\nDynamic sidebar\nImage grid\nDynamic layouts\nGrid patterns\nWant more?\nWrapping up\n\n“Explicit, implicit? What the heck is going on here?”\n\n\nStrange terms, right? Manuel Matuzovic already has a good explanation of what we may by “implicit” and “explicit” in CSS Grid, but let’s dig straight into what the specification says:\n\n\n\nThe grid-template-rows, grid-template-columns, and grid-template-areas properties define a fixed number of tracks that form the explicit grid. When grid items are positioned outside of these bounds, the grid container generates implicit grid tracks by adding implicit grid lines to the grid. These lines together with the explicit grid form the implicit grid.\n\n\n\nSo, in plain English, the browser auto-generates extra rows and columns in case any elements happen to be placed outside the defined grid.\n\n\n\nWhat about auto-placement?\n\n\n\nSimilar to the concept of implicit grid, auto-placement is the ability of the browser to automatically place the items inside the grid. We don’t always need to give the position of each item.\n\n\n\nThrough different use cases, we are going to see how such features can help us create complex and dynamic grid with a few lines of code.\n\n\nDynamic sidebar\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nHere, we have three different layouts but we only have one grid configuration that works for all of them.\n\n\n\nmain {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: 1fr;\n}\n\n\n\nOnly one column is taking up all the free space. This is our “explicit” grid. It’s set up to fit one grid item in the main grid container. That’s all. One column and one row:\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nBut what if we decided to drop another element in there, say an aside (our dynamic sidebar). As it’s currently (and explicitly) defined, our grid will have to adjust automatically to find a place for that element. And if we do nothing else with our CSS, here’s what DevTools tells us is happening.\n\n\n\nThe element takes up the entire column that is explicitly set on the container. Meanwhile, the falls onto a new row between implicit grid lines labeled 2 and 3. Note that I’m using a 20px gap to help separate things visually.\n\n\n\nWe can move the <aside> to a column beside the <section>:\n\n\n\naside {\n  grid-column-start: 2;\n}\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nAnd here’s what DevTools tells us now:\n\n\n\nThe element is between the grid container’s first and second grid column lines. The starts at the second grid column line and ends at a third line we never declared.\n\n\n\nWe place our element in the second column but… we don’t have a second column. Weird, right? We never declared a second column on the <main> grid container, but the browser created one for us! This is the key part from the specification we looked at:\n\n\n\nWhen grid items are positioned outside of these bounds, the grid container generates implicit grid tracks by adding implicit grid lines to the grid.\n\n\n\nThis powerful feature allows us to have dynamic layouts. If we only have the <section> element, all we get is one column. But if we add an <aside> element to the mix, an extra column is created to contain it.\n\n\n\nWe could place the <aside> before the <section> instead like this:\n\n\n\naside {\n  grid-column-end: -2;\n} \n\n\n\nThis creates the implicit column at the start of the grid, unlike the previous code that places the implicit column at the end.\n\n\n\nWe can have either a right or left sidebar\n\n\n\nWe can do the same thing more easily using the grid-auto-flow property to set any and all implicit tracks to flow in a column direction:\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nNow there’s no need to specify grid-column-start to place the <aside> element to the right of the <section>! In fact, any other grid item we decide to throw in there at any time will now flow in a column direction, each one placed in its own implicit grid tracks. Perfect for situations where the number of items in the grid isn’t known in advance!\n\n\n\nThat said, we do still need grid-column-end if we want to place it in a column to the left of it because, otherwise, the <aside> will occupy the explicit column which, in turn, pushes the <section> outside the explicit grid and forces it to take the implicit column.\n\n\n\nI know, I know. That’s a little convoluted. Here is another example we can use to better understand this little quirk:\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nIn the first example, we didn’t specify any placement. In this case, the browser will first place the <aside> element in the explicit column since it comes first in the DOM. The <section>, meanwhile, is automatically placed in the grid column the browser automatically (or implicitly) creates for us.\n\n\n\nIn the second example, we set the <aside> element outside of the explicit grid:\n\n\n\naside {\n  grid-column-end: -2;\n}\n\n\n\nNow it doesn’t matter that <aside> comes first in the HTML. By reassigning <aside> somewhere else, we’ve made the <section> element available to take the explicit column.\n\n\nImage grid\n\n\nLet’s try something different with a grid of images where we have a big image and a few thumbnails beside it (or under it).\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nWe have two grid configurations. But guess what? I am not defining any grid at all! All I am doing is this:\n\n\n\n.grid img:first-child {\n  grid-area: span 3 / span 3;\n}\n\n\n\nIt’s surprising we only need one line of code to pull off something like this, so let’s dissect what’s going on and you will see that it’s easier than you may think. First of all, grid-area is a shorthand property that combines the following properties into a single declaration:\n\n\n\ngrid-row-startgrid-row-endgrid-column-startgrid-column-end\n\n\n\nWait! Isn’t grid-area the property we use to define named areas instead of where elements start and end on the grid?\n\n\n\nYes, but it also does more. We could write a whole lot more about grid-area, but in this particular case:\n\n\n\n.grid img:first-child {\n  grid-area: span 3 / span 3;\n}\n\n/* ...is equivalent to: */\n.grid img:first-child {\n  grid-row-start: span 3;\n  grid-column-start: span 3;\n  grid-row-end: auto;\n  grid-column-end: auto;\n}\n\n\n\nWe can see the same thing when cracking open DevTools to expand the shorthand version:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis means that the first image element in the grid needs to span three columns and three rows. But since we didn’t define any columns or rows, the browser does it for us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’ve essentially placed the first image in the HTML to take up a 3⨉3 grid. That means that any other images will be placed automatically in those same three columns without the need to specify anything new.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo summarize, we told the browser that the first image needs take up the space of three columns and three rows that we never explicitly defined when setting up the grid container. The browser set those columns and rows up for us. As a result, the remaining images in the HTML flow right into place using the same three columns and rows. And since the first image takes up all three columns in the first row, the remaining images flow into additional rows that each contain three columns, where each image takes up a single column.\n\n\n\nAll this from one line of CSS! That’s the power of “implicit” grid” and auto-placement.\n\n\n\nFor the second grid configuration in that demo, all I’ve done is change the automatic flow direction using grid-auto-flow: column the same way we did earlier when placing an <aside> element next to a <section>. This forces the browser to create a fourth column it can use to place the remaining images. And since we have three rows, the remaining images get placed inside the same vertical column.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe need to add a few properties to the images to make sure they fit nicely inside the grid without any overflow:\n\n\n\n.grid {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-gap: 10px;\n}\n\n/* for the second grid configuration */\n.horizontal {\n  grid-auto-flow: column;\n}\n\n/* The large 3⨉3 image */\n.grid img:first-child {\n  grid-area: span 3 / span 3;\n}\n\n/* Help prevent stretched or distorted images */\nimg {\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100%;\n  object-fit: cover;\n}\n\n\n\nAnd of course, we can easily update the grid to consider more images by adjusting one value. That would be the 3 in the styles for the large image. We have this:\n\n\n\n.grid img:first-child {\n  grid-area: span 3 / span 3;\n}\n\n\n\nBut we could add a fourth column simply by changing it to 4 instead:\n\n\n\n.grid img:first-child {\n  grid-area: span 4 / span 4;\n}\n\n\n\nEven better: let’s set that up as a custom property to make things even easier to update.\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\nDynamic layouts\n\n\nThe first use case with the sidebar was our first dynamic layout. Now we will tackle more complex layouts where the number of elements will dictate the grid configuration.\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nIn this example, we can have anywhere from one to four elements where the grid adjusts in way that nicely fits the number of elements without leaving any awkward gaps or missing spaces.\n\n\n\nWhen we have one element, we do nothing. The element will stretch to fill the only row and column automatically created by the grid.\n\n\n\nBit when we add the second element, we create another (implicit) column using grid-column-start: 2.\n\n\n\nWhen we add a third element, it should take up the width of two columns — that’s why we used grid-column-start: span 2, but only if it’s the :last-child because if (and when) we add a fourth element, that one should only take up a single column.\n\n\n\nAdding that up, we have four grid configurations with only two declarations and the magic of implicit grid:\n\n\n\n.grid {\n  display: grid;\n}\n.grid :nth-child(2) {\n  grid-column-start: 2;\n}\n.grid :nth-child(3):last-child {\n  grid-column-start: span 2;\n}\n\n\n\nLet’s try another one:\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nWe’re doing nothing for the first and second cases where we have only one or two elements. When we add a third element, though, we tell the browser that — as long as it’s the :last-child — it should span two columns. When we add a fourth element, we tell the browser that element needs to be placed in the second column.\n\n\n\n.grid {\n  display: grid;\n}\n.grid :nth-child(3):last-child {\n  grid-column-start: span 2;\n}\n.grid :nth-child(4) {\n  grid-column-start: 2;\n}\n\n\n\nAre you starting to get the trick? We give the browser specific instructions based on the number of elements (using :nth-child) and, sometimes, one instruction can change the layout completely.\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that the sizing will not be the same when we work with different content:\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nSince we didn’t define any sizes for our items, the browser automatically sizes them for us based on their contents and we may end up with different sizing than what we just saw. To overcome this, we have to explicitly specify that all the columns and rows are equally sized:\n\n\n\ngrid-auto-rows: 1fr;\ngrid-auto-columns: 1fr;\n\n\n\nHey, we haven’t played with those properties yet! grid-auto-rows and grid-auto-columns set the size of implicit rows and columns, respectively, in a grid container. Or, as the spec explains it:\n\n\n\nThe grid-auto-columns and grid-auto-rows properties specify the size of tracks not assigned a size by grid-template-rows or grid-template-columns.\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nHere is another example where we can go up to six elements. This time I will let you dissect the code. Don’t worry, the selectors may look complex but the logic is pretty straightforward.\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nEven with six elements, we only needed two declarations. Imagine all the complex and dynamic layouts we can achieve with a few lines of code!\n\n\n\nWhat’s going on with that grid-auto-rows and why does it take three values? Are we defining three rows?\n\n\n\nNo, we are not defining three rows. But we are defining three values as a pattern for our implicit rows. The logic is as follows:\n\n\n\nIf we have one row, it will get sized with the first value.If we have two rows, the first one gets the first value and the second one the second value.If we have three rows, the three values will get used.If we have four rows (and here comes the interesting part), we use the three values for the first three rows and we reuse the first value again for the fourth row. That’s why it’s a kind of pattern that we repeat to size all the implicit rows.If we have 100 rows, they will be sized three-by-three to have 2fr 2fr 1fr 2fr 2fr 1fr 2fr 2fr 1fr, etc.\n\n\n\nUnlike grid-template-rows which defines the number of rows and their sizes, grid-auto-rows only sizes row that may get created along the way.\n\n\n\nIf we get back to our example, the logic is to have equal size when two rows are created (we will use the 2fr 2fr), but if a third row is created we make it a bit smaller.\n\n\nGrid patterns\n\n\nFor this last one, we are going to talk about patterns. You have probably seen those two column layouts where one column is wider than the other, and each row alternates the placement of those columns.\n\n\n\nThis sort layout can be difficult too pull off without knowing exactly how much content we’re dealing with, but CSS Grid’s auto-placement powers makes it a relative cinch.\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nTake a peek at the code. It may look complex but let’s break it down because it winds up being pretty straightforward.\n\n\n\nThe first thing to do is to identify the pattern. Ask yourself: “After how many elements should the pattern repeat?” In this case it’s after every four elements. So, let’s look at using only four elements for now:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, let’s define the grid and set up the general pattern using the :nth-child selector for alternating between elements:\n\n\n\n.grid {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-auto-columns: 1fr; /* all the columns are equal */\n  grid-auto-rows: 100px; /* all the rows equal to 100px */\n}\n.grid :nth-child(4n + 1) { /* ?? */ }\n.grid :nth-child(4n + 2) { /* ?? */ }\n.grid :nth-child(4n + 3) { /* ?? */ }\n.grid :nth-child(4n + 4) { /* ?? */ }\n\n\n\nWe said that our pattern repeats every four elements, so we will logically use 4n + x where x ranges from 1 to 4. It’s a little easier to explain the pattern this way:\n\n\n\n4(0) + 1 = 1 = 1st element /* we start with n = 0 */\n4(0) + 2 = 2 = 2nd element\n4(0) + 3 = 3 = 3rd element\n4(0) + 4 = 4 = 4th element\n4(1) + 1 = 5 = 5th element /* our pattern repeat here at n = 1 */\n4(1) + 2 = 6 = 6th element\n4(1) + 3 = 7 = 7th element\n4(1) + 4 = 8 = 8th element\n4(2) + 1 = 9 = 9th element /* our pattern repeat again here at n = 2 */\netc.\n\n\n\nPerfect, right? We have four elements, and repeat the pattern on the fifth element, the ninth element and so on.\n\n\n\nThose :nth-child selectors can be tricky! Chris has a super helpful explanation of how it all works, including recipes for creating different patterns.\n\n\n\nNow we configure each element so that:\n\n\n\nThe first element needs to take two columns and start at column one (grid-column: 1/span 2).The second element is placed in the third column (grid-column-start: 3).The third element is placed at the first column: (grid-column-start: 1).The fourth element takes two columns and starts at the second column: (grid-column: 2/span 2).\n\n\n\nHere that is in CSS:\n\n\n\n.grid {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-auto-columns: 1fr; /* all the columns are equal */\n  grid-auto-rows: 100px; /* all the rows are equal to 100px */\n}\n.grid :nth-child(4n + 1) { grid-column: 1/span 2; }\n.grid :nth-child(4n + 2) { grid-column-start: 3; }\n.grid :nth-child(4n + 3) { grid-column-start: 1; }\n.grid :nth-child(4n + 4) { grid-column: 2/span 2; }\n\n\n\nWe could stop here and be done… but we can do better! Specifically, we can remove some declarations and rely grid’s auto-placement powers to do the job for us. This is the trickiest part to grok and requires a lot of practice to be able to identify what can be removed.\n\n\n\nThe first thing we can do is update grid-column: 1 /span 2 and use only grid-column: span 2 since, by default, the browser will place the first item into the first column. We can also remove this:\n\n\n\n.grid :nth-child(4n + 3) { grid-column-start: 1; }\n\n\n\nBy placing the first, second, and fourth items, the grid automatically places the third item in the correct place. That means we’re left with this:\n\n\n\n.grid {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-auto-rows: 100px; /* all the rows are equal to 100px */\n  grid-auto-columns: 1fr; /* all the columns are equal */\n}\n.grid :nth-child(4n + 1) { grid-column: span 2; }\n.grid :nth-child(4n + 2) { grid-column-start: 3; }\n.grid :nth-child(4n + 4) { grid-column: 2/span 2; }\n\n\n\nBut c’mon we can stroll do better! We can also remove this:\n\n\n\n.grid :nth-child(4n + 2) { grid-column-start: 2; }\n\n\n\nWhy? If we place the fourth element in the second column while allowing it to take up two full columns, we’re forcing the grid to create a third implicit column, giving us a total of three columns without explicitly telling it to. The fourth element cannot go into the first row since the first item is also taking two columns, so it flows to the next row. This configuration leave us with an empty column in the first row and an empty one in the second row.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI think you know the end of the story. The browser will automatically place the second and third items in those empty spots. So our code becomes even simpler:\n\n\n\n.grid {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-auto-columns: 1fr; /* all the columns are equal */\n  grid-auto-rows: 100px; /* all the rows are equal to 100px */\n}\n.grid :nth-child(4n + 1) { grid-column: span 2; }\n.grid :nth-child(4n + 4) { grid-column: 2/span 2; }\n\n\n\nAll it takes is five declarations to create a very cool and very flexible pattern. The optimization part may be tricky, but you get used to it and gain some tricks with practice.\n\n\n\nWhy not use grid-template-columns to define explicit columns since we know the number of columns?\n\n\n\nWe can do that! Here’s the code for it:\n\n\n\n.grid {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); /* all the columns are equal */\n  grid-auto-rows: 100px; /* all the rows are equal to 100px */\n}\n.grid :nth-child(4n + 1),\n.grid :nth-child(4n + 4) {\n  grid-column: span 2;\n}\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the code is definitely more intuitive. We define three explicit grid columns and we tell the browser that the first and fourth elements need to take two columns. I highly recommend this approach! But the goal of this article is to explore new ideas and tricks that we get from CSS Grid’s implicit and auto-placement powers.\n\n\n\nThe explicit approach is more straightforward, while an implicit grid requires you to — pardon the pun — fill in the gaps where CSS is doing additional work behind the scenes. In the end, I believe that having a solid understanding of implicit grids will help you better understand the CSS Grid algorithm. After all, we are not here to study what’s obvious — we are here to explore wild territories!\n\n\n\nLet’s try another pattern, a bit quicker this time:\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nOur pattern repeats every six elements. The third and fourth elements each need to occupy two full rows. If we place the third and the fourth elements, it seems that we don’t need to touch the others, so let’s try the following:\n\n\n\n.grid {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-auto-columns: 1fr;\n  grid-auto-rows: 100px;\n}\n.grid :nth-child(6n + 3) {\n  grid-area: span 2/2; /* grid-row-start: span 2 && grid-column-start: 2 */\n}\n.grid :nth-child(6n + 4) {\n  grid-area: span 2/1; /* grid-row-start: span 2 && grid-column-start: 1 */\n}\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nHmm, no good. We need to place the second element in the first column. Otherwise, the grid will automatically place it in the second column.\n\n\n\n.grid :nth-child(6n + 2) {\n  grid-column: 1; /* grid-column-start: 1 */\n}\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nBetter, but there’s still more work, We need to shift the third element to the top. It’s tempting to try placing it in the first row this way:\n\n\n\n.grid :nth-child(6n + 3) {\n  grid-area: 1/2/span 2; \n    /* Equivalent to:\n       grid-row-start: 1;\n       grid-row-end: span 2;\n       grid-column-start: 2 \n     */\n}\n\n\n\nBut this doesn’t work because it forces all the 6n + 3 elements to get placed in the same area which makes a jumbled layout. The real solution is to keep the initial definition of the third element and add grid-auto-flow: dense to fill the gaps. From MDN:\n\n\n\n[The] “dense” packing algorithm attempts to fill in holes earlier in the grid, if smaller items come up later. This may cause items to appear out-of-order, when doing so would fill in holes left by larger items. If it is omitted, a “sparse” algorithm is used, where the placement algorithm only ever moves “forward” in the grid when placing items, never backtracking to fill holes. This ensures that all of the auto-placed items appear “in order”, even if this leaves holes that could have been filled by later items.\n\n\n\nI know this property is not very intuitive but never forget it when you face a placement issue. Before trying different configurations in vain, add it because it may fix your layout with no additional effort.\n\n\n\nWhy not always add this property by default?\n\n\n\nI don’t recommend it because, in some cases, we don’t want that behavior. Note how the MDN’s explanation there mentions it causes items to flow “out-of-order” to fill holes left by larger items. Visual order is usually just as important as the source order, particularly when it comes to accessible interfaces, and grid-auto-flow: dense can sometimes cause a mismatch between the visual and source order.\n\n\n\nOur final code is then:\n\n\n\n.grid {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-auto-columns: 1fr;\n  grid-auto-flow: dense;\n  grid-auto-rows: 100px;\n}\n.grid :nth-child(6n + 2) { grid-column: 1; }\n.grid :nth-child(6n + 3) { grid-area: span 2/2; }\n.grid :nth-child(6n + 4) { grid-row: span 2; }\n\n\n\nAnother one? Let’s go!\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nFor this one, I will not talk too much and instead show you an illustration of the code I have used. Try to see if you get how I reached that code:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe items in black are implicitly placed in the grid. It should be noted that we can get the same layout more ways than how I got there. Can you figure those out, too? What about using grid-template-columns? Share your works in the comment section.\n\n\n\nI am gonna leave you with a last pattern:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI do have a solution for this one but it’s your turn to practice. Take all that we have learned and try to code this by yourself and then compare it with my solution. Don’t worry if you end with something verbose — the most important thing is finding a working solution.\n\n\nWant more?\n\n\nBefore we end I want to share a few Stack Overflow questions related to CSS Grid where I jumped in with answers that use many of the techniques we covered here together. It’s a good list that shows just how many real use cases and real-world situations come up where these things come in handy:\n\n\n\nChange the number of columns and rows in a grid as the number of items increaseCSS Grid – 2×2 grid always taking up the full width when possibleHow to repeat a CSS grid layout pattern?Create CSS grid layout with pure CSSCSS Grid vs dynamic definition list autoplacementCSS Grid – alternate order of elements only on DesktopImage Tile Using CSS GridHow to fix this complex CSS grid of photos based on 4 columns?Repeating grid layout with unknown amount of itemsCreating a repeating CSS Grid layoutIs it possible to make every second row in a CSS Grid to have different number of columns?Place items in pairs in two rows using css gridHow to set up a dynamic grid based on flex or gridCSS complex grid auto layoutCan I stack a right-hand set of columns with CSS Grid instead of Flex?Change grid layout depending on number of elements\n\n\nWrapping up\n\n\nCSS Grid has been around for years, but there are still a lot of little-known and used tricks that aren’t widely discussed. The implicit grid and auto-placement features are two of them!\n\n\n\nAnd yes, this can get challenging! It has taken me a lot of time to grok the logic behind implicit grids and I still struggle with auto-placement. If you want to spend more time wrapping your head around explicit and implicit grids, here are a couple of additional explanations and examples worth checking out:\n\n\n\n    \t\t\n    \n      \n\n  \n    \n                \n        Article\n      \n\n    on\n\n    Oct 22, 2018  \n\n  \n    \n      Understanding the difference between grid-template and grid-auto    \n  \n\n  \n      \n      grid grid-auto-flow grid-template-columns grid-template-rows implicit grid    \n  \n  \n    \n          \n  \n    \n      Chris Coyier    \n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n                \n        Article\n      \n\n    on\n\n    Jul 28, 2017  \n\n  \n    \n      A Collection of Interesting Facts about CSS Grid Layout    \n  \n\n  \n      \n      grid grid-auto-flow grid-template-columns grid-template-rows implicit grid    \n  \n  \n    \n          \n  \n    \n      Manuel Matuzovic    \n  \n\n\n    \n  \n\n\n\nSimilarly, you might want to read about grid-auto-columns in the CSS-Tricks Almanac because Mojtaba Seyedi goes into great detail and includes incredibly helpful visuals to help explain the behavior.\n\n\n\nLike I said when we started, the methods we covered here are not meant to replace the common ways you already know for building grids.

I wanna tear that apart in just a bit, but a couple of things really draw me into this approach:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>It&#8217;s an example of intentionally cutting off content. We&#8217;ve referred to that as <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/overflow-and-data-loss-in-css/\">CSS data loss</a> in other places. And while data loss is generally a bad thing, I like how it&#8217;s being used here since excerpts are meant to be a teaser for the full content.</li><li>This is different than truncating text with <code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/text-overflow/\">text-overflow: ellipsis</a></code>, a topic that came up rather recently when Eric Eggert <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/text-overflow-ellipsis-considered-harmful/\">shared</a> his concerns with it. The main argument against it is that there is no way to recover the text that gets cut off in the truncation — assistive tech will announce it, but sighted users have no way to recover it. MDNs approach provides a bit more control in that department since the truncation is merely visual.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>So, how did MDN do it? Nothing too fancy here as far the HTML goes, just a container with a paragraph.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"HTML\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">&lt;div class=\"card\">\n  &lt;p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Inventore consectetur temporibus quae aliquam nobis nam accusantium, minima quam iste magnam autem neque laborum nulla esse cupiditate modi impedit sapiente vero?&lt;/p>\n&lt;/div></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>We can drop in a few baseline styles to shore things up.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_mdxBorB\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/mdxBorB?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=mdxBorB&amp;default-tab=css,result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed mdxBorB\" title=\"CodePen Embed mdxBorB\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, nothing too fancy. Our goal is cut the content off after, say, the third line. We can set a <code>max-height</code> on the paragraph and hide the overflow for that:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.card p {\n  max-height: calc(4rem * var(--base)); /* Set a cut-off point for the content */\n  overflow: hidden; /* Cut off the content */\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_rNdGRjB\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/rNdGRjB?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=rNdGRjB&amp;default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed rNdGRjB\" title=\"CodePen Embed rNdGRjB\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Whoa whoa, what&#8217;s up with that <code>calc()</code> stuff? Notice that I set up a <code>--base</code> variable up front that can be used as a common multiplier. I&#8217;m using it to compute the <code>font-size</code>, <code>line-height</code>, <code>padding</code> for the card, and now the <code>max-height</code> of the paragraph. I find it easier to work with a constant values especially when the sizing I need is really based on scale like this. I noticed MDN uses a similar <code>--base-line-height</code> variable, probably for the same purpose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting that third line of text to fade out? It&#8217;s a classic <code>linear-gradient()</code> on the pargraph&#8217;s <code>:after</code> pseudo-element, which is pinned to the bottom-right corner of the card. So, we can set that up:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.card p:after {\n  content: \"\"; /* Needed to render the pseudo */\n  background-image: linear-gradient(to right, transparent, var(--background) 80%);\n  position: absolute;\n  inset-inline-end: 0; /* Logical property equivalent to `right: 0` */\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Notice I&#8217;m calling a <code>--background</code> variable that&#8217;s set to the same background color value that&#8217;s used on the <code>.card</code> itself. That way, the text appears to fade into the background. And I found that I needed to tweak the second color stop in the gradient because the text isn&#8217;t completely hidden when the gradient blends all the way to 100%. I found <code>80%</code> to be a sweet spot for my eyes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, yes, <code>:after</code> needs a <code>height</code> and <code>width</code>. The <code>height</code> is where that <code>--base</code> variables comes back into play because we want that scaled to the paragraph&#8217;s <code>line-height</code> in order to cover the text with the height of <code>:after</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.card p:after {\n  /* same as before */\n  height: calc(1rem * var(--base) + 1px);\n  width: 100%; /* relative to the .card container */\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"is-style-explanation\">Adding one extra pixel of height seemed to do the trick, but MDN was able to pull it off without it when I peeked at DevTools. Then again, I&#8217;m not using <code>top</code> (or <code>inset-block-start</code>) to offset the gradient in that direction either. &#x1f937;&#x200d;&#x2642;&#xfe0f;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that <code>p:after</code> is absolutely positioned, we need to explicitly declare relative positioning on the paragraph to keep <code>:after</code> in its flow. Otherwise, <code>:after</code> would be completely yanked from the document flow and wind up outside of the card. This becomes the full CSS for the <code>.card</code> paragraph:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.card p {\n  max-height: calc(4rem * var(--base)); /* Set a cut-off point for the content */\n  overflow: hidden; /* Cut off the content */\n  position: relative; /* needed for :after */\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re done, right? Nope!

      "content_text": "It’s no secret that MDN rolled out a new design back in March. It’s gorgeous! And there are some sweet CSS-y gems in it that are fun to look at. One of those gems is how card components handle truncated text.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPretty cool, yeah? I wanna tear that apart in just a bit, but a couple of things really draw me into this approach:\n\n\n\nIt’s an example of intentionally cutting off content. We’ve referred to that as CSS data loss in other places. And while data loss is generally a bad thing, I like how it’s being used here since excerpts are meant to be a teaser for the full content.This is different than truncating text with text-overflow: ellipsis, a topic that came up rather recently when Eric Eggert shared his concerns with it. The main argument against it is that there is no way to recover the text that gets cut off in the truncation — assistive tech will announce it, but sighted users have no way to recover it. MDNs approach provides a bit more control in that department since the truncation is merely visual.\n\n\n\nSo, how did MDN do it? Nothing too fancy here as far the HTML goes, just a container with a paragraph.\n\n\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Inventore consectetur temporibus quae aliquam nobis nam accusantium, minima quam iste magnam autem neque laborum nulla esse cupiditate modi impedit sapiente vero?</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\nWe can drop in a few baseline styles to shore things up.\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nAgain, nothing too fancy. Our goal is cut the content off after, say, the third line. We can set a max-height on the paragraph and hide the overflow for that:\n\n\n\n.card p {\n  max-height: calc(4rem * var(--base)); /* Set a cut-off point for the content */\n  overflow: hidden; /* Cut off the content */\n}\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nWhoa whoa, what’s up with that calc() stuff? Notice that I set up a --base variable up front that can be used as a common multiplier. I’m using it to compute the font-size, line-height, padding for the card, and now the max-height of the paragraph. I find it easier to work with a constant values especially when the sizing I need is really based on scale like this. I noticed MDN uses a similar --base-line-height variable, probably for the same purpose.\n\n\n\nGetting that third line of text to fade out? It’s a classic linear-gradient() on the pargraph’s :after pseudo-element, which is pinned to the bottom-right corner of the card. So, we can set that up:\n\n\n\n.card p:after {\n  content: \"\"; /* Needed to render the pseudo */\n  background-image: linear-gradient(to right, transparent, var(--background) 80%);\n  position: absolute;\n  inset-inline-end: 0; /* Logical property equivalent to `right: 0` */\n}\n\n\n\nNotice I’m calling a --background variable that’s set to the same background color value that’s used on the .card itself. That way, the text appears to fade into the background. And I found that I needed to tweak the second color stop in the gradient because the text isn’t completely hidden when the gradient blends all the way to 100%. I found 80% to be a sweet spot for my eyes.\n\n\n\nAnd, yes, :after needs a height and width. The height is where that --base variables comes back into play because we want that scaled to the paragraph’s line-height in order to cover the text with the height of :after.\n\n\n\n.card p:after {\n  /* same as before */\n  height: calc(1rem * var(--base) + 1px);\n  width: 100%; /* relative to the .card container */\n}\n\n\n\nAdding one extra pixel of height seemed to do the trick, but MDN was able to pull it off without it when I peeked at DevTools. Then again, I’m not using top (or inset-block-start) to offset the gradient in that direction either. 🤷‍♂️\n\n\n\nNow that p:after is absolutely positioned, we need to explicitly declare relative positioning on the paragraph to keep :after in its flow. Otherwise, :after would be completely yanked from the document flow and wind up outside of the card. This becomes the full CSS for the .card paragraph:\n\n\n\n.card p {\n  max-height: calc(4rem * var(--base)); /* Set a cut-off point for the content */\n  overflow: hidden; /* Cut off the content */\n  position: relative; /* needed for :after */\n}\n\n\n\nWe’re done, right? Nope! The dang gradient just doesn’t seem to be in the right position.\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nI’ll admit I brain-farted on this one and fired up DevTools on MDN to see what the heck I was missing. Oh yeah, :after needs to be displayed as a block element. It’s clear as day when adding a red border to it.🤦‍♂️\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\n.card p:after {\n  content: \"\";\n  background: linear-gradient(to right, transparent, var(--background) 80%);\n  display: block;\n  height: calc(1rem * var(--base) + 1px);\n  inset-block-end: 0;\n  position: absolute;\n  width: 100%;\n}\n\n\n\nAll together now!\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nAnd, yep, looks sounds like VoiceOver respects the full text. I haven’t tested any other screen readers though.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI also noticed that MDN’s implementation removes pointer-events from p:after. Probably a good defensive tactic to prevent odd behaviors when selecting text. I added it in and selecting text does feel a little smoother, at least in Safari, Firefox, and Chrome.\n\nRecreating MDN’s Truncated Text Effect originally published on CSS-Tricks.

      "content_html": "<p>URL Shorteners are tools we use to make links shorter than they actually are. With a URL Shortener, you can transform a long link (maybe for a registration form or article) into a shorter version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Behind the scenes, the long and short versions of a given link have been stored in some database. Then when a user visits the short link in a browser, the URL Shortener will redirect the user to the long version of the link (where the actual content is found).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shortened links from URL shorteners are commonly used when the long version of those links would be too long to use. Sharing links on social media or when designing flyers and adverts is a popular use of URL shorteners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For one of my projects, I created a personal URL shortener. My intention was to use it for links to articles I write or videos I make. I used&nbsp;<a href=\"https://keepdeploying.com/7754377478e0\" rel=\"noopener\">Firebase to build the backend of the URL shortener.</a>&nbsp;Specifically, I used the Firestore database to store short and long versions of any given link.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To create links, I had to use the Firebase console. This wasn&#8217;t a problem but it was cumbersome for the high frequency of editing links. The user experience (UX) was not ideal. Now I was faced with a problem. How do I create, edit, and delete links? I needed to build a frontend for the URL shortener. I needed a website for this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we&#8217;ll review the available tools used for building this frontend, decision choices, and factors that influenced why they were made.</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-367003\"></span>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"problem-statement\">Problem statement</h2>\n\n\n<p>The project requirements were:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Platform/Architecture</strong>. The engineering and structure of the coding process.</li><li><strong>UI Toolkit</strong>. Components to use for the various parts of the UI.</li><li><strong>Convenience</strong>. Building the backend was not tough, so this frontend should not be either. I wanted clean code and fast development.</li></ul>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"the-first-decision-choice-angular\">The First Decision Choice: Angular</h2>\n\n\n<p>Many ideas come to mind when starting out to build a frontend. In a broad sense, we could categorize frontend building options into 3 platforms:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Website Builders &#8211; like WordPress, Wix, Squarespace, etc.</li><li>Vanilla Building &#8211; using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li><li>JavaScript Framework &#8211; like React, Vue, Angular, etc.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>In my experience, website builders provide a very restricted collection of widgets, components, and templates. Most website builders don&#8217;t provide an easy way to integrate an entire custom backend like Firebase. While it is possible to build impressive sites by connecting these pieces together, the degree of complexity of my project was likely beyond what these services typically provide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using the no-framework style or vanilla would have been a possibility. However, the deciding factor that made me not choose the pure vanilla route was that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/learn-more#modular-version\" rel=\"noopener\">the latest non-CDN version of the Firebase JavaScript SDK (Version 9)</a>&nbsp;is designed with installation via <code>npm</code> or <code>yarn</code> and module bundling in mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>JavaScript frameworks handle frontend core parts (like routing, backend-linking, etc.) to reduce developer efforts. There are many of them and choosing which to use seemed to be a harder choice to make.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many JavaScript frameworks for frontend development. Examples include Angular, React, Vue, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of the available frameworks, I have the most familiarity with Angular. This is because I have used it on previous projects like:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/obumnwabude/choircarolquiz\" rel=\"noopener\">Choir Carol Quiz</a>: Portal where Quiz participants competed in two online rounds of timed multiple choice questions on select Bible chapters.</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/obumnwabude/genesys-community\" rel=\"noopener\">Genesys AE-FUNAI Community</a>: Custom Form where members of Genesys Campus Club AE-FUNAI (my community) report their progress and share their achievements.</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/obumnwabude/tutorialmgt\" rel=\"noopener\">Tutorial Management System</a>: Simple session management dashboard between students and tutors.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This familiarity allows me to build quickly with Angular. Being able to build quickly should not be underestimated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I chose Angular because of its Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) ability. OOP is a programming paradigm that focuses more on classes, data, or state being managed, rather than on the logic controlling the data, as is the case with functional programming. Separation of concerns is one advantage of using OOP. In other words, OOP permits encapsulation. It permits you to scope aspects of the program to peculiar domains or classes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Angular, components (and their lifecycle methods) are scoped to TypeScript classes. This makes you think the OOP way. The OOP advantage reflects in how Angular components serve as reusable UI units in the Angular framework. That way you see an Angular component as some self-sufficient entity that is yet part of a whole. This makes frontend development easy as various parts of the frontend app can be scoped to components and hence can be used where needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also chose Angular because it uses TypeScript. TypeScript is JavaScript with features of a typed programming language. Typing in this context means a variable can&#8217;t change the kind of value it holds all through its life. For example, a variable holding a string will not all of a sudden hold a number while it is used in that program. Typing increases code quality and reduces bugs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result of its type system, TypeScript reduces the time spent debugging Angular apps. It gives developer experience as the developer will have more time to build the frontend app. Debugging also becomes easy for the developer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"is-style-explanation\">Note: <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-classes-in-typescript?utm_source=css-tricks.com&amp;utm_medium=cta&amp;utm_campaign=why-i-chose-angular-to-build-a-url-shortener\">Here is more on Object-Oriented Programming with TypeScript</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, on Angular&#8217;s advantages, Angular apps come as a complete setup. They handle important features like bundling CSS preprocessors or Angular services by themselves. That said, when using Angular, you don&#8217;t need to configure each library independently, Angular takes care of this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An Angular service is what Angular uses to configure dependency injection. In simple terms, dependency injection is providing an application with what it needs to function (dependencies) without the application having to take care of how the dependencies were gotten. I also chose Angular because of its out-of-the-box handling of services. So Firebase, for example, will be auto-provided to all Angular components that need without any extra configuration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The benefits of Object-Oriented Programming, TypeScript, and dependency injection make Angular a go-to for frontend development. Coupled with the fact I was already familiar with Angular, Angular was more convenient for this URL shortener project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/tag/angular/\">Angular articles on CSS-Tricks</a>&nbsp;are also part of the story. They gave me more confidence with using Angular.</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"the-second-decision-choice-material-design\">The Second Decision Choice: Material Design</h2>\n\n\n<p>After choosing Angular, my next task was to consider how I would handle the user interface (UI).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could ignore and do vanilla CSS instead but why reinvent the wheel? After all, this would defeat the reason for using a JavaScript framework &#8211; convenience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With choosing a UI toolkit, there seems to be an ocean of options. To name a few, one can use Bootstrap, Bulma, Semantic UI, Tailwind, etc. Each toolkit has its own specifications and motivations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the use case of my project, Material Design led the pack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most important factors was the support for Angular and Material Design. There is an entire Angular-only specification for Material on&nbsp;<code>material.angular.io</code>&nbsp;(that is as a subdomain to the Angular docs itself).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I settled for Material Design because it focuses on components. Unlike other CSS frameworks, it doesn&#8217;t have CSS utility classes. This was okay because I only wanted some component kit (buttons, icons, inputs, sidebars, snack bars, etc.) Material also adds animations, ripple, and shadow effects by itself; making it more convenient than other libraries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, Angular Material has out-of-the-box theming support, when initializing Angular Material, you have the option of choosing a pre-defined theme for the entire Angular app or creating a custom one.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"464\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/angular-url-shortener-theme.png?resize=1024%2C464&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Screenshot of installing Angular Material and selecting a theme.\" class=\"wp-image-367010\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/angular-url-shortener-theme.png?resize=1024%2C464&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/angular-url-shortener-theme.png?resize=300%2C136&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/angular-url-shortener-theme.png?resize=768%2C348&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/angular-url-shortener-theme.png?w=1437&amp;ssl=1 1437w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For the sake of convenience, I chose a dark theme while setting up Angular Material.</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"the-third-decision-choice-reactive-forms\">The Third Decision Choice: Reactive Forms</h2>\n\n\n<p>With a framework and toolkit decided, I turned my attention to one of the most important features of the URL shortener. The core of the URL shortener&#8217;s frontend is the form for creating and updating links.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s call this form the links editor. The links editor form has only two inputs, one for the short version of a link and the other for the full URL the short version will redirect to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For managing forms, Angular comes with two mechanisms. So instead of creating a form and handling its validation and submission as is done in vanilla HTML and JavaScript, you have to use either of the two ways Angular provides. The two methods are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Template-driven forms</li><li>Reactive forms</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://angular.io/guide/forms\" rel=\"noopener\">Template-driven forms</a>&nbsp;as the name imply, involve the HTML (template) code controlling the greater part of the Angular form. This approach is preferable when your form does not do much or is for one-time usage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://angular.io/guide/reactive-forms\" rel=\"noopener\">Reactive forms</a>, on the other hand, provide a model-driven approach to handling form inputs whose values change over time. I needed reactive forms because it is the same form that I will use to edit different links at any point in time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"is-style-explanation\">Note: <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/angular-reactive-forms-introduction?utm_source=css-tricks.com&amp;utm_medium=cta&amp;utm_campaign=why-i-chose-angular-to-build-a-url-shortener\">Here is more material on using Reactive Forms.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this point, the benefits of previous choices began playing out. Angular Material has&nbsp;<code>form-field</code>&nbsp;components. The&nbsp;<code>form-field</code>&nbsp;wraps the input as a component and provides animations, ripple effects, and error messages if necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/angular-url-shortener-link-form.gif?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Animated gif of short and long URLs entered into a form.\" class=\"wp-image-367014\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/angular-url-shortener-link-form.gif?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/angular-url-shortener-link-form.gif?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/angular-url-shortener-link-form.gif?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So I used it for the two inputs of the editor form.</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"the-fourth-decision-choice-angular-material-bottom-sheet-and-drawer\">The Fourth Decision Choice: Angular Material Bottom Sheet and Drawer</h2>\n\n\n<p>The final decision involved how to improve the user experience. The URL shortener would need other features like viewing all created links and their analytics. These features would require space on the screen that required me to rethink if there were better solutions to display the links editor form to the user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the user has no current need for the links editor form, it makes sense for the links editor form to not always be in view. This would free up space on the UI for other elements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, splitting this user experience into two separate pages felt disruptive. Instead, to open the links editor when needed, I added a floating action button on the page for creating links. When clicked, the button will cause the editor form to be opened in any fitting UI component.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://material.angular.io/components/bottom-sheet/overview\" rel=\"noopener\">bottom sheet</a>, as the name implies, is a UI component that opens from the bottom of the screen. It has interactive content the user can work it. It overlays the current view of a mobile screen (but doesn&#8217;t fully block it).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"470\" height=\"834\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/angular-url-shortener-link-bottom-sheet.gif?resize=470%2C834&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Animated gif of interacting with a form displayed in a Bottom Sheet.\" class=\"wp-image-367015\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Bottom sheets are usually used in place of pop-ups if the user will spend a long time interacting with their content. So, bottom sheets are a good fit to open the editor on mobile screens. However, interacting with a bottom sheet is hard when the screen is wide.

      "content_text": "URL Shorteners are tools we use to make links shorter than they actually are. With a URL Shortener, you can transform a long link (maybe for a registration form or article) into a shorter version.\n\n\n\nBehind the scenes, the long and short versions of a given link have been stored in some database. Then when a user visits the short link in a browser, the URL Shortener will redirect the user to the long version of the link (where the actual content is found).\n\n\n\nShortened links from URL shorteners are commonly used when the long version of those links would be too long to use. Sharing links on social media or when designing flyers and adverts is a popular use of URL shorteners.\n\n\n\nFor one of my projects, I created a personal URL shortener. My intention was to use it for links to articles I write or videos I make. I used Firebase to build the backend of the URL shortener. Specifically, I used the Firestore database to store short and long versions of any given link.\n\n\n\nTo create links, I had to use the Firebase console. This wasn’t a problem but it was cumbersome for the high frequency of editing links. The user experience (UX) was not ideal. Now I was faced with a problem. How do I create, edit, and delete links? I needed to build a frontend for the URL shortener. I needed a website for this.\n\n\n\nIn this article, we’ll review the available tools used for building this frontend, decision choices, and factors that influenced why they were made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem statement\n\n\nThe project requirements were:\n\n\n\nPlatform/Architecture. The engineering and structure of the coding process.UI Toolkit. Components to use for the various parts of the UI.Convenience. Building the backend was not tough, so this frontend should not be either. I wanted clean code and fast development.\n\n\nThe First Decision Choice: Angular\n\n\nMany ideas come to mind when starting out to build a frontend. In a broad sense, we could categorize frontend building options into 3 platforms:\n\n\n\nWebsite Builders – like WordPress, Wix, Squarespace, etc.Vanilla Building – using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.JavaScript Framework – like React, Vue, Angular, etc.\n\n\n\nIn my experience, website builders provide a very restricted collection of widgets, components, and templates. Most website builders don’t provide an easy way to integrate an entire custom backend like Firebase. While it is possible to build impressive sites by connecting these pieces together, the degree of complexity of my project was likely beyond what these services typically provide.\n\n\n\nUsing the no-framework style or vanilla would have been a possibility. However, the deciding factor that made me not choose the pure vanilla route was that the latest non-CDN version of the Firebase JavaScript SDK (Version 9) is designed with installation via npm or yarn and module bundling in mind.\n\n\n\nJavaScript frameworks handle frontend core parts (like routing, backend-linking, etc.) to reduce developer efforts. There are many of them and choosing which to use seemed to be a harder choice to make.\n\n\n\nThere are many JavaScript frameworks for frontend development. Examples include Angular, React, Vue, etc.\n\n\n\nOf the available frameworks, I have the most familiarity with Angular. This is because I have used it on previous projects like:\n\n\n\nChoir Carol Quiz: Portal where Quiz participants competed in two online rounds of timed multiple choice questions on select Bible chapters.Genesys AE-FUNAI Community: Custom Form where members of Genesys Campus Club AE-FUNAI (my community) report their progress and share their achievements.Tutorial Management System: Simple session management dashboard between students and tutors.\n\n\n\nThis familiarity allows me to build quickly with Angular. Being able to build quickly should not be underestimated.\n\n\n\nI chose Angular because of its Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) ability. OOP is a programming paradigm that focuses more on classes, data, or state being managed, rather than on the logic controlling the data, as is the case with functional programming. Separation of concerns is one advantage of using OOP. In other words, OOP permits encapsulation. It permits you to scope aspects of the program to peculiar domains or classes.\n\n\n\nIn Angular, components (and their lifecycle methods) are scoped to TypeScript classes. This makes you think the OOP way. The OOP advantage reflects in how Angular components serve as reusable UI units in the Angular framework. That way you see an Angular component as some self-sufficient entity that is yet part of a whole. This makes frontend development easy as various parts of the frontend app can be scoped to components and hence can be used where needed.\n\n\n\nI also chose Angular because it uses TypeScript. TypeScript is JavaScript with features of a typed programming language. Typing in this context means a variable can’t change the kind of value it holds all through its life. For example, a variable holding a string will not all of a sudden hold a number while it is used in that program. Typing increases code quality and reduces bugs.\n\n\n\nAs a result of its type system, TypeScript reduces the time spent debugging Angular apps. It gives developer experience as the developer will have more time to build the frontend app. Debugging also becomes easy for the developer.\n\n\n\nNote: Here is more on Object-Oriented Programming with TypeScript\n\n\n\nStill, on Angular’s advantages, Angular apps come as a complete setup. They handle important features like bundling CSS preprocessors or Angular services by themselves. That said, when using Angular, you don’t need to configure each library independently, Angular takes care of this.\n\n\n\nAn Angular service is what Angular uses to configure dependency injection. In simple terms, dependency injection is providing an application with what it needs to function (dependencies) without the application having to take care of how the dependencies were gotten. I also chose Angular because of its out-of-the-box handling of services. So Firebase, for example, will be auto-provided to all Angular components that need without any extra configuration.\n\n\n\nThe benefits of Object-Oriented Programming, TypeScript, and dependency injection make Angular a go-to for frontend development. Coupled with the fact I was already familiar with Angular, Angular was more convenient for this URL shortener project.\n\n\n\nAngular articles on CSS-Tricks are also part of the story. They gave me more confidence with using Angular.\n\n\nThe Second Decision Choice: Material Design\n\n\nAfter choosing Angular, my next task was to consider how I would handle the user interface (UI).\n\n\n\nI could ignore and do vanilla CSS instead but why reinvent the wheel? After all, this would defeat the reason for using a JavaScript framework – convenience.\n\n\n\nWith choosing a UI toolkit, there seems to be an ocean of options. To name a few, one can use Bootstrap, Bulma, Semantic UI, Tailwind, etc. Each toolkit has its own specifications and motivations.\n\n\n\nFor the use case of my project, Material Design led the pack.\n\n\n\nOne of the most important factors was the support for Angular and Material Design. There is an entire Angular-only specification for Material on material.angular.io (that is as a subdomain to the Angular docs itself).\n\n\n\nI settled for Material Design because it focuses on components. Unlike other CSS frameworks, it doesn’t have CSS utility classes. This was okay because I only wanted some component kit (buttons, icons, inputs, sidebars, snack bars, etc.) Material also adds animations, ripple, and shadow effects by itself; making it more convenient than other libraries.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, Angular Material has out-of-the-box theming support, when initializing Angular Material, you have the option of choosing a pre-defined theme for the entire Angular app or creating a custom one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the sake of convenience, I chose a dark theme while setting up Angular Material.\n\n\nThe Third Decision Choice: Reactive Forms\n\n\nWith a framework and toolkit decided, I turned my attention to one of the most important features of the URL shortener. The core of the URL shortener’s frontend is the form for creating and updating links.\n\n\n\nLet’s call this form the links editor. The links editor form has only two inputs, one for the short version of a link and the other for the full URL the short version will redirect to.\n\n\n\nFor managing forms, Angular comes with two mechanisms. So instead of creating a form and handling its validation and submission as is done in vanilla HTML and JavaScript, you have to use either of the two ways Angular provides. The two methods are:\n\n\n\nTemplate-driven formsReactive forms\n\n\n\nTemplate-driven forms as the name imply, involve the HTML (template) code controlling the greater part of the Angular form. This approach is preferable when your form does not do much or is for one-time usage.\n\n\n\nReactive forms, on the other hand, provide a model-driven approach to handling form inputs whose values change over time. I needed reactive forms because it is the same form that I will use to edit different links at any point in time.\n\n\n\nNote: Here is more material on using Reactive Forms.\n\n\n\nAt this point, the benefits of previous choices began playing out. Angular Material has form-field components. The form-field wraps the input as a component and provides animations, ripple effects, and error messages if necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo I used it for the two inputs of the editor form.\n\n\nThe Fourth Decision Choice: Angular Material Bottom Sheet and Drawer\n\n\nThe final decision involved how to improve the user experience. The URL shortener would need other features like viewing all created links and their analytics. These features would require space on the screen that required me to rethink if there were better solutions to display the links editor form to the user.\n\n\n\nIf the user has no current need for the links editor form, it makes sense for the links editor form to not always be in view. This would free up space on the UI for other elements.\n\n\n\nHowever, splitting this user experience into two separate pages felt disruptive. Instead, to open the links editor when needed, I added a floating action button on the page for creating links. When clicked, the button will cause the editor form to be opened in any fitting UI component.\n\n\n\nA bottom sheet, as the name implies, is a UI component that opens from the bottom of the screen. It has interactive content the user can work it. It overlays the current view of a mobile screen (but doesn’t fully block it).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBottom sheets are usually used in place of pop-ups if the user will spend a long time interacting with their content. So, bottom sheets are a good fit to open the editor on mobile screens. However, interacting with a bottom sheet is hard when the screen is wide. I needed a different UI component for the links editor form on wide screens.\n\n\n\nDrawers open by the side. Using a drawer to open the links editor form on a wide screen was the go-to option. Drawers won’t be good for the editor on mobile screens. The screen’s width would be relatively small and the drawer might completely block the screen (which is not a desirable UX).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI selected these two UI components from Material Design for the form to have some responsive effect. So whether on my phone or laptop creating links would be done in a fitting UI component.\n\n\n\nIn the code, Angular checks if the device is of small screen width. If so, it opens a bottom sheet containing the links editor form. On the other hand, if the screen is wide, Angular opens a drawer containing the same form.\n\n\n\nUsing these two components brought about a minor complication. If my phone is rotated or my laptop’s browser window’s width is reduced, the form opens on the contrary UI component. That is instead of opening in a drawer in a laptop, it will open in a bottom sheet (because the browser’s width was reduced).\n\n\nMaintenance, Future-proofing, Future Releases\n\n\nWhen I thought of opportunities to iterate on this project, I ran into limitations with the current use case designed to support a single administrator. But with authentication and user accounts, it can support additional users managing links and accessing analytics.\n\n\n\nIn that case, the above choices of components will still be appropriate. The links editor is responsive so on any device, users will have a good user experience.\n\n\n\nIf I had to do it all over again, I think I would have tried out the vanilla method. Building entirely without any helpers like Angular, Material, or UI components. I would try building from scratch in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and see if I didn’t lose out on convenience as I thought I would.\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nYou can access the final Angular code here on GitHub.\n\n\n\nThis was a review of some of the main choices I made when developing my project. Of course, there is more to building the frontend of a URL shortener. But for a start, these UI components made the building process convenient. They made the links editor form responsive and could be of similar use to you in your projects (not necessarily a URL shortener).\n\n\n\nThere are many other UI components from various libraries you can use for any such project. But as with my case, if convenience is a deciding factor, you would make the right decision choice that would be fitting for the UI.\n\n\n\nUltimately, what shaped my decisions was understanding what my project required, knowledge of tools I had used from previous projects, and expectations with time constraints. My past experience — successes and mistakes — helped guide me too.\n\n\n\nCheers!\n\nWhy I Chose Angular to Build a URL Shortener originally published on CSS-Tricks. You should get the newsletter.",

It also meant we had enough space for when my daughters (yep, we had another along the way!) needed a homeschooling hub.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"762\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/homeschool-desk.jpg?resize=1024%2C762&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-366922\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/homeschool-desk.jpg?resize=1024%2C762&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/homeschool-desk.jpg?resize=300%2C223&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/homeschool-desk.jpg?resize=768%2C571&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/homeschool-desk.jpg?w=1128&amp;ssl=1 1128w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So, back-of-the-napkin math tells me we had four humans in one office heading into 2020. I can&#8217;t overstate just how lucky we were to have an office like this at a time like that. It was often hectic, yes, but still gave us everything we needed (and more) to be a truly home-based family <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/video/2017/mar/10/bbc-correspondent-interrupted-by-his-children-live-on-air-video\" rel=\"noopener\">without becoming meme fodder</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>All of this leads me back to Jim&#8217;s post and why his comment about life revolving around desks bit me so hard. After spending so many years unraveling my life from the office, I found myself spending too much time last night curating the desk at my new home. I was essentially letting it re-establish itself as a sacred anchor in my life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here I am trying to put Jim&#8217;s next piece of advice into action:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>It’s ok to have a bit of humility in your space. Perhaps a dose of it is even deserved.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>That means my desk is not the center of the room that it&#8217;s in. It&#8217;s a work in progress, but so far  the desk is pushed off to the side up against a wall. Behind it is a reclaimed sofa I can easily retreat to. Across from that are my guitars and ukuleles for mental breaks where I get to use my hands more than my mind. Next to those is my record collection and turntable — another refuge that encourages me to step away from the screen and indulge other interests.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG_0670-scaled.jpeg?resize=2560%2C1920&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-366936\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG_0670-scaled.jpeg?w=2560&amp;ssl=1 2560w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG_0670-scaled.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG_0670-scaled.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG_0670-scaled.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG_0670-scaled.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG_0670-scaled.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 2048w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>I&#8217;ll get some artwork up on the walls at some point.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And all of it is in a space large and welcoming enough to invite life in if it needs to — family, friends, fiddling around, whatever.

      "content_text": "I think it’s super timely that Jim Nielsen wrote about his office space the other day. My family recently re-rooted in Colorado and I was up late last night setting up my desk and everything around it. So late, in fact, that reading these words now bites me:\n\n\n\nMy workspace isn’t what life revolves around.\n\n\n\nI’ve spent years trying to live up to that. I remember how important my desk was to me when I began freelancing in 2013. Remote working was an outlier then and having a desk made me feel better whenever I told someone I worked from home and I got the inevitable “Oh, you’ll get a real job one day,” look.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt doesn’t look like much, but that minimalism took me forever to figure out (circa October 2013).\n\n\n\nThat helped my ego, sure. But it didn’t stop my 6-month old daughter from climbing the stairs to find me. We lived in an open concept condo at the time, and the living room stairs bled straight into my office as the landing.\n\n\n\nTo be fair, it’s not like I was stopping her either.\n\n\n\nThat meant I sometimes had a tiny art director looking over my shoulder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n…but it also forced me to find different spots to get some work done:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYanking the power cord from my office wall made me realize I could work anywhere I really needed to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThankfully, I lived in an urban downtown that had plenty of cafés I could use as an office in a pinch.\n\n\n\nI used to love Zurb’s templates for sketching wireframes.\n\n\n\nIf I’m being honest, I’ve probably done more work outside of my office than I ever have in it. It was right around this time that I had clients plugging me into various accounts for Slack, Zoom, Dropbox, Google Drive, and other tools that we now credit for creating asynchronous working environments. Other than a new banging set of Beats, there was nothing else I really needed to invest in to work this way.\n\n\n\nThese were all things I was already using for myself, but it was my clients buying into them that really felt like the sea change that allowed me to call anywhere I was sitting “my” desk.\n\n\n\nFast-forward to 2019. We moved to the ‘burbs into a house that gave me the luxury of a large dedicated office space.\n\n\n\nCheck out that killer poster on the wall.\n\n\n\nMy desk started to grow into the larger space.\n\n\n\nI was recording a lot of screencasts and lectures at the time. Thankfully, Chris had a bunch of practical recommendations for a homespun studio.\n\n\n\nI really lucked out when we moved because the extra space came in handy when my wife, Marcia, starting working exclusively from home following the start of the pandemic. It also meant we had enough space for when my daughters (yep, we had another along the way!) needed a homeschooling hub.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, back-of-the-napkin math tells me we had four humans in one office heading into 2020. I can’t overstate just how lucky we were to have an office like this at a time like that. It was often hectic, yes, but still gave us everything we needed (and more) to be a truly home-based family without becoming meme fodder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of this leads me back to Jim’s post and why his comment about life revolving around desks bit me so hard. After spending so many years unraveling my life from the office, I found myself spending too much time last night curating the desk at my new home. I was essentially letting it re-establish itself as a sacred anchor in my life.\n\n\n\nSo here I am trying to put Jim’s next piece of advice into action:\n\n\n\nIt’s ok to have a bit of humility in your space. Perhaps a dose of it is even deserved.\n\n\n\nThat means my desk is not the center of the room that it’s in. It’s a work in progress, but so far  the desk is pushed off to the side up against a wall. Behind it is a reclaimed sofa I can easily retreat to. Across from that are my guitars and ukuleles for mental breaks where I get to use my hands more than my mind. Next to those is my record collection and turntable — another refuge that encourages me to step away from the screen and indulge other interests.\n\n\n\nI’ll get some artwork up on the walls at some point.\n\n\n\nAnd all of it is in a space large and welcoming enough to invite life in if it needs to — family, friends, fiddling around, whatever. It’s also conveniently located right off the family room for such distractions  moments.\n\n\nWhat’s on my desk\n\n\nIt feels odd to sign off without showing you what’s actually on my desk. It’s fun knowing what people use and how they’re set up. Here’s what I’ve got.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst off, the desk itself is this one from IKEA.\n\n\n\n16″ MacBook Pro (2019)Apple Magic Keyboard (no charging or TouchID)Apple Magic Trackpad (with charging)27″ LG UltraFine 4K external monitor (2016, discontinued)27″ Dell UltraSharp 4K USB-C monitor (thank you, DigitalOcean!)Shure SM7B microphone (with mount)Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 microphone preampDBX 286s microphone preamp processorUBeesize 12’’ Ring Light with Tripod (the room is super dark)Grogu (aka Baby Yoda) and Bob Belcher figuresOrange cup for pens and a Seth Godin action figureSammy stress ball\n\n\nWhat’s your office like?\n\n\nIs it a traditional office you commute to?

      "content_html": "<p>Hooks are reusable functions. They allow you to use <strong>state</strong> and other features (e.g. lifecycle methods and so on) without writing a class. Hook functions let us “hook into” the <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/the-circle-of-a-react-lifecycle/\">React state lifecycle</a> using functional components, allowing us to manipulate the state of our functional components without needing to convert them to class components.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>React <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html\" rel=\"noopener\">introduced hooks</a> back in version 16.8 and has been adding more ever since. Some are more used and popular than others, like <code>useEffect</code>, <code>useState</code>, and <code>useContext</code> hooks. I have no doubt that you’ve reached for those if you work with React.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what I’m interested in are the lesser-known React hooks. While all React hooks are interesting in their own way, there are five of them that I really want to show you because they may not pop up in your everyday work — or maybe they do and knowing them gives you some extra superpowers.</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-366770\"></span>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-2 wp-block-group ticss-b32e7816\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\"><h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents</h2><ul class=\"simpletoc-list\"   >\n<li>\n<a  href=\"#usereducer\">useReducer</a></li><li>\n<a  href=\"#useref\">useRef</a></li><li>\n<a  href=\"#useimperativehandle\">useImperativeHandle</a></li><li>\n<a  href=\"#usememo\">useMemo</a></li><li>\n<a  href=\"#usecallback\">useCallback</a></li><li>\n<a  href=\"#final-thoughts\">Final thoughts</a></li></ul></div></div>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"usereducer\"><code>useReducer</code></h3>\n\n\n<p>The <code>useReducer</code> hook is a state management tool like other hooks. Specifically, it is an alternative to the <code>useState</code> hook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you use the <code>useReducer</code> hook to change two or more states (or actions), you won’t have to manipulate those states individually. The hook keeps track of all the states and collectively manages them. In other words: it manages and re-renders state changes. Unlike the <code>useState</code> hook, <code>useReducer</code> is easier when it comes to handling many states in complex projects.</p>\n\n\n<h4 id=\"use-cases\">Use cases</h4>\n\n\n<p><code>useReducer</code> can help reduce the complexity of working with multiple states. Use it when you find yourself needing to track multiple states collectively, as it allows you to treat state management and the rendering logic of a component as separate concerns.</p>\n\n\n<h4 id=\"syntax\">Syntax</h4>\n\n\n<p><code>useReducer</code> accepts three arguments, one of which is optional:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>a reducer function</li><li><code>initialState</code></li><li>an <code>init</code> function (optional)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState)\nconst [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState initFunction) // in the case where you initialize with the optional 3rd argument</code></pre>\n\n\n<h4 id=\"example\">Example</h4>\n\n\n<p>The following example is an interface that contains a text input, counter, and button. Interacting with each element updates the state. Notice how <code>useReducer</code> allows us to define multiple cases at once rather than setting them up individually.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">import { useReducer } from 'react';\nconst reducer = (state, action) => {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'INCREMENT':\n      return { ...state, count: state.count + 1 };\n    case 'DECREMENT':\n      return { ...state, count: state.count - 1 };\n    case 'USER_INPUT':\n      return { ...state, userInput: action.payload };\n    case 'TOGGLE_COLOR':\n      return { ...state, color: !state.color };\n    default:\n      throw new Error();\n  }\n}\n\nfunction App() {\n  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { count: 0, userInput: '', color: false })\n\n  return (\n    &lt;main className=\"App, App-header\" style={{ color: state.color ?

This is the power it gives when working in complex applications with multiple states.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"useref\"><code>useRef</code></h3>\n\n\n<p>The <code>useRef</code> hook is used to create refs on elements in order to access the DOM. But more than that, it returns an object with a <code>.current</code> property that can be used throughout a component’s entire lifecycle, allowing data to persist without causing a re-render. So, the <code>useRef</code> value stays the same between renders; updating the reference does not trigger a re-render.</p>\n\n\n<h4 id=\"use-cases\">Use cases</h4>\n\n\n<p>Reach for the <code>useRef</code> hook when you want to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Manipulate the DOM with stored mutable information.</li><li>Access information from child components (nested elements).</li><li>Set focus on an element.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s most useful when storing mutatable data in your app without causing a re-render.</p>\n\n\n<h4 id=\"syntax\">Syntax</h4>\n\n\n<p><code>useRef</code> only accepts one argument, which is the <strong>initial value</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">const newRefComponent = useRef(initialValue);</code></pre>\n\n\n<h4 id=\"example\">Example</h4>\n\n\n<p>Here I used the <code>useRef</code> and <code>useState</code> hook to show the amount of times an application renders an updated state when typing in a text input.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">import './App.css'\n\nfunction App() {\n  const [anyInput, setAnyInput] = useState(\" \");\n  const showRender = useRef(0);\n  const randomInput = useRef();\n  const toggleChange = (e) => {\n    setAnyInput (e.target.value);\n    showRender.current++;\n  \n  }\n  const focusRandomInput = () => {\n    randomInput.current.focus();\n  }\n\n  return (\n    &lt;div className=\"App\">\n      &lt;input className=\"TextBox\" \n        ref ={randomInput} type=\"text\" value={anyInput} onChange={toggleChange}\n      />\n      &lt;h3>Amount Of Renders: {showRender.current}&lt;/h3>\n      &lt;button onClick={focusRandomInput}>Click To Focus On Input &lt;/button>\n    &lt;/div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Notice how typing each character in the text field updates the app’s state, but never triggers a complete re-render.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe src=\"https://codesandbox.io/embed/useref-1ubcyf?fontsize=14&amp;hidenavigation=1&amp;theme=dark\" style=\"width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;\" title=\"UseRef\" allow=\"accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts\"></iframe>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"useimperativehandle\"><code>useImperativeHandle</code></h3>\n\n\n<p>You know how a child component has access to call functions passed down to them from the parent component? Parents pass those down via props, but that transfer is “unidirectional” in the sense that the parent is unable to call a function that’s in the child.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, <code>useImperativeHandle</code> makes it possible for a parent to access a child component’s functions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How does that work?</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A function is defined in the child component.</li><li>A <code>ref</code> is added in the parent.</li><li>We use <code>forwardRef</code>, allowing the <code>ref</code> that was defined to be passed to the child.</li><li><code>useImperativeHandle</code> exposes the child’s functions via the <code>ref</code>.</li></ul>\n\n\n<h4 id=\"use-cases\">Use cases</h4>\n\n\n<p><code>useImperativeHandle</code> works well when you want a parent component to be affected by changes in the child.

      "content_text": "Hooks are reusable functions. They allow you to use state and other features (e.g. lifecycle methods and so on) without writing a class. Hook functions let us “hook into” the React state lifecycle using functional components, allowing us to manipulate the state of our functional components without needing to convert them to class components.\n\n\n\nReact introduced hooks back in version 16.8 and has been adding more ever since. Some are more used and popular than others, like useEffect, useState, and useContext hooks. I have no doubt that you’ve reached for those if you work with React.\n\n\n\nBut what I’m interested in are the lesser-known React hooks. While all React hooks are interesting in their own way, there are five of them that I really want to show you because they may not pop up in your everyday work — or maybe they do and knowing them gives you some extra superpowers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nuseReducer\nuseRef\nuseImperativeHandle\nuseMemo\nuseCallback\nFinal thoughts\n\n\nuseReducer\n\n\nThe useReducer hook is a state management tool like other hooks. Specifically, it is an alternative to the useState hook.\n\n\n\nIf you use the useReducer hook to change two or more states (or actions), you won’t have to manipulate those states individually. The hook keeps track of all the states and collectively manages them. In other words: it manages and re-renders state changes. Unlike the useState hook, useReducer is easier when it comes to handling many states in complex projects.\n\n\nUse cases\n\n\nuseReducer can help reduce the complexity of working with multiple states. Use it when you find yourself needing to track multiple states collectively, as it allows you to treat state management and the rendering logic of a component as separate concerns.\n\n\nSyntax\n\n\nuseReducer accepts three arguments, one of which is optional:\n\n\n\na reducer functioninitialStatean init function (optional)\n\n\n\nconst [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState)\nconst [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState initFunction) // in the case where you initialize with the optional 3rd argument\n\n\nExample\n\n\nThe following example is an interface that contains a text input, counter, and button. Interacting with each element updates the state. Notice how useReducer allows us to define multiple cases at once rather than setting them up individually.\n\n\n\nimport { useReducer } from 'react';\nconst reducer = (state, action) => {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'INCREMENT':\n      return { ...state, count: state.count + 1 };\n    case 'DECREMENT':\n      return { ...state, count: state.count - 1 };\n    case 'USER_INPUT':\n      return { ...state, userInput: action.payload };\n    case 'TOGGLE_COLOR':\n      return { ...state, color: !state.color };\n    default:\n      throw new Error();\n  }\n}\n\nfunction App() {\n  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { count: 0, userInput: '', color: false })\n\n  return (\n    <main className=\"App, App-header\" style={{ color: state.color ? '#000' : '#FF07FF'}}>\n      <input style={{margin: '2rem'}}\n        type=\"text\"\n        value={state.userInput}\n        onChange={(e) => dispatch({ type: 'USER_INPUT', payload: e.target.value })}\n      />\n      <br /><br />\n      <p style={{margin: '2rem'}} >{state.count}</p>\n      <section style={{margin: '2rem'}}>\n        <button  onClick={(() => dispatch({ type: 'DECREMENT' }))}>-</button>\n        <button onClick={(() => dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' }))}>+</button>\n        <button onClick={(() => dispatch({ type: 'TOGGLE_COLOR' }))}>Color</button>\n      </section>\n      <br /><br />\n      <p style={{margin: '2rem'}}>{state.userInput}</p>\n    </main>\n  );\n}\nexport default App;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the code above, noticed how we are able to easily managed several states in the reducer (switch-case), this shows the benefit of the useReducer. This is the power it gives when working in complex applications with multiple states.\n\n\nuseRef\n\n\nThe useRef hook is used to create refs on elements in order to access the DOM. But more than that, it returns an object with a .current property that can be used throughout a component’s entire lifecycle, allowing data to persist without causing a re-render. So, the useRef value stays the same between renders; updating the reference does not trigger a re-render.\n\n\nUse cases\n\n\nReach for the useRef hook when you want to:\n\n\n\nManipulate the DOM with stored mutable information.Access information from child components (nested elements).Set focus on an element.\n\n\n\nIt’s most useful when storing mutatable data in your app without causing a re-render.\n\n\nSyntax\n\n\nuseRef only accepts one argument, which is the initial value.\n\n\n\nconst newRefComponent = useRef(initialValue);\n\n\nExample\n\n\nHere I used the useRef and useState hook to show the amount of times an application renders an updated state when typing in a text input.\n\n\n\nimport './App.css'\n\nfunction App() {\n  const [anyInput, setAnyInput] = useState(\" \");\n  const showRender = useRef(0);\n  const randomInput = useRef();\n  const toggleChange = (e) => {\n    setAnyInput (e.target.value);\n    showRender.current++;\n  \n  }\n  const focusRandomInput = () => {\n    randomInput.current.focus();\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"App\">\n      <input className=\"TextBox\" \n        ref ={randomInput} type=\"text\" value={anyInput} onChange={toggleChange}\n      />\n      <h3>Amount Of Renders: {showRender.current}</h3>\n      <button onClick={focusRandomInput}>Click To Focus On Input </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n\n\n\nNotice how typing each character in the text field updates the app’s state, but never triggers a complete re-render.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuseImperativeHandle\n\n\nYou know how a child component has access to call functions passed down to them from the parent component? Parents pass those down via props, but that transfer is “unidirectional” in the sense that the parent is unable to call a function that’s in the child.\n\n\n\nWell, useImperativeHandle makes it possible for a parent to access a child component’s functions.\n\n\n\nHow does that work?\n\n\n\nA function is defined in the child component.A ref is added in the parent.We use forwardRef, allowing the ref that was defined to be passed to the child.useImperativeHandle exposes the child’s functions via the ref.\n\n\nUse cases\n\n\nuseImperativeHandle works well when you want a parent component to be affected by changes in the child. So, things like a changed focus, incrementing and decrementing, and blurred elements may be situations where you find yourself reaching for this hook so the parent can be updated accordingly.\n\n\nSyntax\n\n\nuseImperativeHandle (ref, createHandle, [dependencies])\n\n\nExample\n\n\nIn this example, we have two buttons, one that’s in a parent component and one that’s in a child. Clicking on the parent button retrieves data from the child, allowing us to manipulate the parent component. It’s set up so that clicking the child button does not pass anything from the parent component to the child to help illustrate how we are passing things in the opposite direction.\n\n\n\n// Parent component\nimport React, { useRef } from \"react\";\nimport ChildComponent from \"./childComponent\";\nimport './App.css';\n\nfunction useImperativeHandle() {\n  const controlRef = useRef(null);\n  return (\n    onClick={\n      () => {\n        controlRef.current.controlPrint();\n      }\n    }\n    >\n    Parent Box\n  );\n}\nexport default useImperativeHandle;\n\n\n\n// Child component\nimport React, { forwardRef, useImperativeHandle, useState } from \"react\";\n\nconst ChildComponent = forwardRef((props, ref) => {\n  const [print, setPrint] = useState(false);\n  useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({\n    controlPrint() \n    { setPrint(!print); },\n  })\n  );\n\n  return (\n    <>\n    Child Box\n    { print && I am from the child component }\n  );\n});\n\nexport default ChildComponent;\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n\nuseMemo\n\n\nuseMemo is one of the least-used but most interesting React hooks. It can improve performance and decrease latency, particularly on large computations in your app. How so? Every time a component’s state updates and components re-render, the useMemo hook prevents React from having to recalculate values.\n\n\n\nYou see, functions respond to state changes. The useMemo hook takes a function and returns the return value of that function. It caches that value to prevent spending additional effort re-rendering it, then returns it when one of the dependencies has changed.\n\n\n\nThis process is called memoization and it’s what helps to boost performance by remembering the value from a previous request so it can be used again without repeating all that math.\n\n\nUse cases\n\n\nThe best use cases are going to be any time you’re working with heavy calculations where you want to store the value and use it on subsequent state changes. It can be a nice performance win, but using it too much can have the exact opposite effect by hogging your app’s memory.\n\n\nSyntax\n\n\nuseMemo( () => \n  { // Code goes here },\n  []\n)\n\n\nExample\n\n\nWhen clicking the button, this mini-program indicates when a number is even or odd, then squares the value. I added lots of zeros to the loop to increase its computation power. It returns the value in spilt seconds and still works well due to the useMemo hook.\n\n\n\n// UseMemo.js\nimport React, { useState, useMemo } from 'react'\n\nfunction Memo() {\n  const [memoOne, setMemoOne] = useState(0);\n  const incrementMemoOne = () => { setMemoOne(memoOne + 1) }\n  const isEven = useMemo(() => { \n    let i = 0 while (i < 2000000000) i++ return memoOne % 2 === 0\n  },\n  [memoOne]);\n  \n  const square = useMemo(()=> { \n    console.log(\"squared the number\"); for(var i=0; i < 200000000; i++);\n    return memoOne * memoOne;\n  },\n  [memoOne]);\n\n  return (\n    Memo One - \n    { memoOne }\n    { isEven ? 'Even' : 'Odd' } { square } \n  );\n}\nexport default Memo\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuseMemo is a little like the useCallback hook, but the difference is that useMemo can store a memorized value from a function, where useCallback stores the memorized function itself.\n\n\nuseCallback\n\n\nThe useCallback hook is another interesting one and the last section was sort of a spoiler alert for what it does.\n\n\n\nAs we just saw, useCallback works like the useMemo hook in that they both use memoization to cache something for later use. While useMemo stores a function’s calculation as a cached value, useCallback stores and returns a function.\n\n\nUse cases\n\n\nLike useMemo, useCallback is a nice performance optimization in that it stores and returns a memoized callback and any of its dependencies without a re-render.\n\n\nSyntax\n\n\nconst getMemoizedCallback = useCallback (\n  () => { doSomething () }, []\n);\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n{ useCallback, useState } from \"react\";\nimport CallbackChild from \"./UseCallback-Child\";\nimport \"./App.css\"\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [toggle, setToggle] = useState(false);\n  const [data, setData] = useState(\"I am a data that would not change at every render, thanks to the useCallback\");\n  const returnFunction = useCallback(\n    (name) => \n    { return data + name; }, [data]\n  );\n  return (\n    onClick={() => {\n      setToggle(!toggle);\n    }}\n    >\n    {\" \"}\n\n    // Click To Toggle\n    { toggle && h1.

Now, before you hop over there looking for nuggets on CSS box shadows, text shadows, and shadow filters&#8230; this is <em>not that</em>. It&#8217;s an essay on photography and what Robin has learned about handing shadows with a camera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, why share this? Because it&#8217;s cool as heck that he made an article directed page dedicated to one essay. And you&#8217;ll learn a lot about CSS if you crack open DevTools on it:</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-366896\"></span>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Centering techniques.</strong> Notice how CSS Grid is used on the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> simply to <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/centering-css-complete-guide/\">center the pamphlet</a>. Then Robin reaches for it again on each <code>.frame</code> of the essay to do the same thing with the content.</li><li><strong>&#8220;Faux&#8221; background images.</strong> Robin could have made a lot of work for himself by creating a CSS class for each <code>.frame</code> to get the background images. Instead, he uses <code>object-fit: cover</code> on inlined HTML <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>s to maintain the aspect ratio while filling the <code>.frame</code> container. (He&#8217;s actually <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/on-object-fit-and-object-position/\">written about this</a> before.) That sure saves a lot of CSS&#8217;ing, but it also allows him to use alt text if needed. I sorta wonder if a <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code>/<code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> structure could&#8217;ve worked here instead but I doubt it would provide much additional benefit for what&#8217;s going on.</li><li><strong>Stacking contexts.</strong> Another perk of those faux background images? They use absolute positioning which creates a stacking context, allowing Robin to set a <code>z-index: 0</code> on the images. That way, the text stacks directly on top with <code>z-index: 1</code>. Again, CSS Grid is handling all the centering so things are nicely aligned.</li><li><strong>Scroll snapping.</strong> I always <em>love</em> it when I see CSS scroll snapping in the wild.

      "content_text": "Our dear friend Robin has a new essay called In Praise of Shadows. Now, before you hop over there looking for nuggets on CSS box shadows, text shadows, and shadow filters… this is not that. It’s an essay on photography and what Robin has learned about handing shadows with a camera.\n\n\n\nSo, why share this? Because it’s cool as heck that he made an article directed page dedicated to one essay. And you’ll learn a lot about CSS if you crack open DevTools on it:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCentering techniques. Notice how CSS Grid is used on the <body> simply to center the pamphlet. Then Robin reaches for it again on each .frame of the essay to do the same thing with the content.“Faux” background images. Robin could have made a lot of work for himself by creating a CSS class for each .frame to get the background images. Instead, he uses object-fit: cover on inlined HTML <img>s to maintain the aspect ratio while filling the .frame container. (He’s actually written about this before.) That sure saves a lot of CSS’ing, but it also allows him to use alt text if needed. I sorta wonder if a <figure>/<figcaption> structure could’ve worked here instead but I doubt it would provide much additional benefit for what’s going on.Stacking contexts. Another perk of those faux background images? They use absolute positioning which creates a stacking context, allowing Robin to set a z-index: 0 on the images. That way, the text stacks directly on top with z-index: 1. Again, CSS Grid is handling all the centering so things are nicely aligned.Scroll snapping. I always love it when I see CSS scroll snapping in the wild. Robin made a nice choice to use it here, as it really lends to the whole page-turning experience while scrolling through frames. Horizontal scrolling can be maddening, but also extremely elegant when executed well as it is here in how it enhances the narrow-column design. If you want a nice explanation of how it all works, Robin has also written about horizontal scroll snapping.\n\n\n\nIf nothing else, Robin is an excellent writer and it’s worth reading anything he publishes, CSS and beyond.\nTo Shared Link — Permalink on CSS-Tricks\nIn Praise of Shadows originally published on CSS-Tricks.

Whatever the case, a developer isn’t writing code 24/7, because as this poll suggests, we’re spending plenty of time doing other things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That might include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>demoing a new feature,</li><li>documenting that new feature,</li><li>updating a work ticket related to that new feature, or</li><li>backlogging work to support that new feature.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, there&#8217;s always time for bathroom breaks and Wordle too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, most of the things we typically do involve communicating with people like your team, colleagues, clients, users, and other developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we do spend a good chunk of our time communicating with humans through <em>words</em> in addition to the communication we have with computers through <em>code</em>. Words are written language. And if we wrote our words better, we’d communicate better. When we communicate better, we’re more likely to get what we want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s Technical Writing 101.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Slide-16_9-1-1-1.png?resize=1600%2C900&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Venn diagram showing the overlap between technical writing and coding.\" class=\"wp-image-366612\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Slide-16_9-1-1-1.png?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Slide-16_9-1-1-1.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Slide-16_9-1-1-1.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Slide-16_9-1-1-1.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Slide-16_9-1-1-1.png?resize=1536%2C864&amp;ssl=1 1536w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And it doesn’t even end here.. Some programmers also like to make their own products, which means they need to make marketing part of their job. Technical writing plays a huge role in that too. So, yeah.

Even &#8220;is&#8221; can be considered an action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>Marcia <em>codes</em> in the morning and <em>answers</em> emails in the afternoon.</p>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-34 wp-block-columns ticss-e4f8b41b\">\n<div class=\"wp-container-31 wp-block-column\">\n<div class=\"wp-container-30 wp-block-group ticss-fffde8ac\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\"><h5 id=\"adjectives\">Adjectives</h5>\n\n\n<p>Adjectives are how we describe nouns. They&#8217;re like meta that adds more detail to a sentence to paint a vivid picture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>CSS is an <em>elegant</em> and <em>poetic</em> language.</li><li>The HTML for tables is <em>complex</em> and <em>cumbersome</em>.</li><li>The Box Model is <em>important</em> to understand CSS.</li></ul>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-33 wp-block-column\">\n<div class=\"wp-container-32 wp-block-group ticss-1c86492d\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\"><h5 id=\"prepositions\">Prepositions</h5>\n\n\n<p>Prepositions create a relationship between a noun and other words, often indicating direction, time, location, and space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Did you commit your work <em>to</em> the repo?</li><li>What is the best approach <em>for</em> this component?</li><li>We conducted interviews <em>with</em> real users.</li></ul>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-39 wp-block-columns ticss-369ad070\">\n<div class=\"wp-container-36 wp-block-column\">\n<div class=\"wp-container-35 wp-block-group ticss-1facf0ac\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\"><h5 id=\"adverbs\">Adverbs</h5>\n\n\n<p>Sometimes actions need to be more specific, so we use adverbs such as “runs <em>fast</em>” and “compiles <em>slowly</em>.” They often end in &#8220;-ly.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>This is <em>easily</em> the best idea of them all.</li><li>Chip waited <em>patiently</em> for Dale&#8217;s feedback.</li><li>The team worked <em>diligently</em> on the project.</li></ul>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-38 wp-block-column\">\n<div class=\"wp-container-37 wp-block-group ticss-416e3630\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\"><h5 id=\"conjunctions\">Conjunctions</h5>\n\n\n<p>Conjunctions connect phrases in a sentence. <a href=\"https://schoolhouserock.fandom.com/wiki/Conjunction_Junction\" rel=\"noopener\">Remember this classic song</a> from the show <em>School House Rocks</em>?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>CSS for styling <em>while</em> HTML is for markup.</li><li>Yes, I write code, <em>but </em>I also work on design.</li><li>That fixes the bug. <em>Yet</em> it introduced a new one.</li></ul>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-44 wp-block-columns ticss-d349e3b1\">\n<div class=\"wp-container-41 wp-block-column\">\n<div class=\"wp-container-40 wp-block-group ticss-dd0482d7\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\"><h5 id=\"transitions\">Transitions</h5>\n\n\n<p>Paragraphs are made of sentences that are connected to each other using transitions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>There are many programming languages. <em>However</em>, only a few are used in the web industry.</li><li><em>First</em>, clone the directory.</li><li>I like this approach but <em>on the other hand</em>, I know another one.</li></ul>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-43 wp-block-column\">\n<div class=\"wp-container-42 wp-block-group ticss-86b4bb41\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\"><h5 id=\"pronouns\">Pronouns</h5>\n\n\n<p>When nouns become repetitive, we replace them with pronouns such as: “he,&#8221; “it,&#8221; and “that.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>CSS is a stylesheet language. We use <em>it</em> to style websites.</li><li>Tony loves to code and <em>he</em> practices every day.</li><li>Our customers are tech-savvy because <em>they</em> know code.</li></ul>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Think of these like <abbr>UI</abbr> components: they are modular pieces you can move around to construct a complete and robust sentence, the same way you might piece together a complete and robust <abbr>UI</abbr>. Do all of the components need to be there all of the time? Certainly not! Assemble a sentence with the pieces you need to complete the experience, just as you would with an interface.</p>\n\n\n<h4 id=\"voice-and-tone\">Voice and tone</h4>\n\n\n<p>Vocabulary, punctuation, sentence structure, and word choice. These are all the ingredients of English. We use them to share ideas, communicate with our friends and family, and send emails to our coworkers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s crucial to consider the <em>sound</em> of our messages. It&#8217;s amazing how one exclamation point can completely shift the tone of a message:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>I like programming.</li><li>I <em>like</em> programming! :)</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to confuse voice for tone, and vice versa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><dfn id=\"voice\"><strong>Voice</strong></dfn> is what concerns our choice of words, which depends on context. For example, a tutorial for beginners is more likely to use slang and informal language to convey a friendly voice, whereas documentation might be written in a formal, serious, and professional manner in an effort to get straight to the point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same message, written in two different voices:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Fun: </strong>“Expand your social network and stay updated on what’s trending now.”</li><li><strong>Serious: </strong>“Find jobs on one of the largest social networking apps and online jobs market.”</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not unusual to accidentally write messages that come across as condescending, offensive, and unprofessional. This is where <strong><dfn id=\"tone\">tone</dfn></strong> comes into play. <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/read-your-website/\">Read your messages out loud</a>, get other people to read them for you, and experiment with your punctuation and sentence structure. That&#8217;s how you hone your tone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s another way to think of it: your voice never changes, but your tone does. Your voice is akin to who you are as a person, whereas tone is how you respond in a given situation.</p>\n\n\n<h4 id=\"active-and-passive-voice\">Active and passive voice</h4>\n\n\n<p>A sentence always contains an actor, a verb, and a target. The order in which these come determines if the sentence is written in an active or passive voice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The actor comes first in an <strong><dfn id=\"active-voice\">active voice</dfn></strong>. For example: “CSS paints the background.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sentences that use an active voice are more straightforward than their counterparts. They&#8217;re clearer, shorter, and more understandable — perfect for a more professional voice that gets straight to the point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a <strong><dfn id=\"passive-voice\">passive voice</dfn></strong>, the actor comes last. (See what I did there?) That means our actor — CSS in this case — comes at the end like this: “The background is painted by CSS.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Readers usually convert a passive voice to an active voice in their heads, resulting in more processing time. If you&#8217;ve ever heard that writing in an active voice is better, this is usually the reason why. Tech writers prefer the active voice most of the time, with very few exceptions such as citing research: “It has been suggested that …”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that doesn&#8217;t mean you should always strive for an active voice. Switching from one to the other — even in the same paragraph — can make your content flow more seamlessly from one sentence to another if used effectively.</p>\n\n\n<h4 id=\"avoiding-mistakes\">Avoiding mistakes</h4>\n\n\n<p>Grammar is all about the structure and correctness of language, and there&#8217;s nothing better to achieve that than a quick proofreading of your document. It&#8217;s very important to rid your writings of spelling mistakes, grammar issues, and semantic imperfections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of this article, I&#8217;ll show you the invaluable tools that professionals use to avoid writing mistakes. Obviously, there are built-in spell checkers in just about everything these days; our code editors even have spell-checking and linting plugins to help prevent mistakes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you&#8217;re looking for a one-stop tool for all-things grammar, <a href=\"https://www.grammarly.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">Grammarly</a> is one of the most widely-used tools. I&#8217;m not getting a kickback for that or anything. It&#8217;s just a really great tool that many editors and writers use to write clean and clear content — similar to how you might use Emmet, eslint, or any other linter to write clean and clear code.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"writing-code-comments\">Writing code comments</h3>\n\n\n<p>The things we write for other developers can have a big impact on the overall quality of our work, whether it&#8217;s what we write in the code, how we explain the code, or how we give feedback on a piece of code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s interesting that every programming language comes with a standard set of features to write a comment. They should explain what the code is doing. By that, I don’t mean vague comments like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">red *= 1.2 // Multiply `red` by 1.2 and re-assign it</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, use comments that provide more information:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">red *= 1.2 // Apply a 'reddish' effect to the image</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s all about context. “What kind of program am I building?” is exactly the kind of question you should be asking yourself.</p>\n\n\n<h4 id=\"comments-should-add-value\">Comments should add value</h4>\n\n\n<p>Before we look at what makes a &#8220;good&#8221; code comment, here are two examples of lazy comments:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">const age = 32 // Initialize `age` to 32</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">filter: blur(32px); /* Create a blur effect with a 32px radius */</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that the purpose of a comment is to add value to a piece of code, not to repeat it. If you can’t do that, you’re better off just leaving the code as-is. What makes these examples &#8220;lazy&#8221; is that they merely restate what the code is obviously doing. In this case, the comments are redundant because they tell us what we already know — they aren&#8217;t adding value!</p>\n\n\n<h4 id=\"comments-should-reflect-the-current-code\">Comments should reflect the current code</h4>\n\n\n<p>Out-of-date comments are no rare sight in large projects; dare I say in <em>most</em> projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s imagine David, a programmer and an all-around cool guy to hang out with. David wants to sort a list of strings alphabetically from A to Z, so he does the obvious in JavaScript:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">cities = sortWords(cities) // sort cities from A to Z</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>David then realizes that sortWords() actually sorts lists from Z to A. That’s not a problem, as he can simply reverse the output:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">cities = sortWords(cities) // sort cities from A to Z\ncities = reverse(cities)</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, David didn’t update his code comment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now imagine that I didn’t tell you this story, and all you saw was the code above. You’d naturally think that after running that second line of code, `cities` would be sorted from Z to A! This whole confusion fiasco was caused by a stale comment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While this might be an exaggerated example, something similar can (and often does) happen if you’re racing against a close deadline. Thankfully, this can be prevented by following one simple rule… <strong>change your comments the same time you change the code.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s one simple rule that will save you and your team from a lot of <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/defining-and-dealing-with-technical-debt/\">technical debt</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we know what poorly written comments look like, let&#8217;s look at some good examples.</p>\n\n\n<h4 id=\"comments-should-explain-unidiomatic-code\">Comments should explain unidiomatic code</h4>\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, the <em>natural</em> way of doing things isn’t right. Programmers might have to “break” the standards a bit, but when they do, it’s advisable to leave a little comment explaining their rationale:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\"> function addSetEntry(set, value) {    \n  /* Don't return `set.add` because it's not chainable in IE 11. */  \n  set.add(value);\n  return set;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s helpful, right? If you were responsible for reviewing this code, you may have been tempted to correct it without that comment there explaining what&#8217;s up.</p>\n\n\n<h4 id=\"comments-can-identify-future-tasks\">Comments can identify future tasks</h4>\n\n\n<p>Another useful thing to do with comments is to admit that there’s more work to be done.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">// TODO: use a more efficient algorithm\nlinearSort(ids)</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>This way, you can stay focused on your flow. And at a later date, you (or someone else) can come back and fix it.</p>\n\n\n<h4 id=\"comments-can-link-back-to-the-source\">Comments can link back to the source</h4>\n\n\n<p>So, you just found a solution to your problem on StackOverflow. After copy-pasting that code, it’s sometimes a good thing to keep a link to the answer that helped you out so you can come back to it for future reference.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"705\" height=\"318\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/stackoverflow-answer-link.png?resize=705%2C318&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Screenshot of copying a link at StackOverflow.\" class=\"wp-image-366646\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/stackoverflow-answer-link.png?w=705&amp;ssl=1 705w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/stackoverflow-answer-link.png?resize=300%2C135&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">// Adds handling for legacy browsers\n// https://stackoverflow.com/a/XXXXXXX</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>This is important because solutions can change. It’s always good to know where your code came from in case it ever breaks.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"writing-pull-requestsnbsp\">Writing pull requests </h3>\n\n\n<p><strong><dfn id=\"pr\">Pull requests</dfn></strong> (<abbr>PR</abbr>s) are a fundamental aspect of any project. They sit at the heart of code reviews. And code reviews can quickly become a bottleneck in your team’s performance without good wording.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A good <abbr>PR</abbr> description summarizes <em>what</em> change is being made and <em>why</em> it’s being made. Large projects have a pull request template, like this one adapted from a <a href=\"https://github.com/appium/appium/issues/new\" rel=\"noopener\">real example</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"Markdown \" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">## Proposed changes\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request.\n\n## Types of changes\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Appium?\n - [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\n - [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\n - ...\n\n## Checklist\n - [ ] I have read the CONTRIBUTING doc\n - [ ] I have signed the CLA\n - [ ] Lint and unit tests pass locally with my changes\n\n## Further comments\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc…</code></pre>\n\n\n<h4 id=\"avoid-vague-pr-titles\">Avoid vague <abbr>PR</abbr> titles</h4>\n\n\n<p>Please avoid titles that look like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Fix build.</li><li>Fix bug.</li><li>Add patch.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These don’t even <em>attempt</em> to describe what build, bug, or patch it is we&#8217;re dealing with. A little extra detail on what part of the build was fixed, which bug was squashed, or what patch was added can go a long way to establishing better communication and collaboration with your colleagues. It level-sets and gets folks on the same page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><abbr>PR</abbr> titles are traditionally written in <a href=\"https://www.grammarly.com/blog/imperative-sentences/\" rel=\"noopener\">imperative tense</a>. They’re a one-line summary of the entire <abbr>PR</abbr>, and they should describe <em>what</em> is being done by the <abbr>PR</abbr>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some good examples:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Support custom srcset attributes in NgOptimizedImage</li><li>Default image config to 75% image quality</li><li>Add explicit selectors for all built-in ControlValueAccessors</li></ul>\n\n\n<h4 id=\"avoid-long-prs\">Avoid long <abbr>PR</abbr>s</h4>\n\n\n<p>A large <abbr>PR</abbr> means a huge description, and no one wants to review hundreds or thousands of lines of code, sometimes just to end-up dismissing the whole thing!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, you could:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>communicate with your team through <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues\" rel=\"noopener\">Issues</a>,</li><li>make a plan,</li><li>break down the problem into smaller pieces, or</li><li>work on each piece separately with its own <abbr>PR</abbr>.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Isn’t it much cleaner now?</p>\n\n\n<h4 id=\"provide-details-in-the-pr-body\">Provide details in the <abbr>PR</abbr> body</h4>\n\n\n<p>Unlike the <abbr>PR</abbr> title, the body is <em>the</em> place for all the details, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Why is the <abbr>PR</abbr> being done?</li><li>Why is this the best approach?</li><li>Any shortcomings to the approach, and ideas to solve them if possible</li><li>The bug or ticket number, benchmark results, etc.</li></ul>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"reporting-bugs\">Reporting bugs</h3>\n\n\n<p>Bug reports are one of the most important aspects of any project. And all great projects are built on user feedback. Usually, even after countless tests, it’s the users that find most bugs. Users are also great idealists, and sometimes they have feature ideas; please listen to them!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For technical projects, all of this stuff is done by reporting issues. A well-written issue is easy for another developer to find and respond to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, most big projects come with <a href=\"https://github.com/angular-translate/angular-translate/blob/1114534c064eddfb77fc4243b0deb61c37f5f41f/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md\" rel=\"noopener\">a template</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"Markdown\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\"> &lt;!-- Modified from angular-translate/angular-translate -->\n ### Subject of the issue\n Describe your issue here.\n\n ### Your environment\n * version of angular-translate\n * version of angular\n * which browser and its version\n\n ### Steps to reproduce\n Tell us how to reproduce this issue.\n\n ### Expected behavior\n Tell us what should happen.\n\n ### Actual behavior\n Tell us what happens instead.</code></pre>\n\n\n<h4 id=\"gather-screenshots\">Gather screenshots</h4>\n\n\n<p>Capture the issue using your <a href=\"https://www.take-a-screenshot.org/\" rel=\"noopener\">system’s screen-shooting utility</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it’s a screenshot of a <abbr>CLI</abbr> program, make sure that the text is clear. If it’s a <abbr>UI</abbr> program, make sure the screenshot captures the right elements and states.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may need to capture an actual interaction to demonstrate the issue. If that&#8217;s the case, try to <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/makin-gifs/\">record GIFs using a screen-recording tool</a>.</p>\n\n\n<h4 id=\"how-to-reproduce-the-problem\">How to reproduce the problem</h4>\n\n\n<p>It’s much easier for programmers to solve a bug when it’s live on their computer. That’s why a good commit message should come with the steps to precisely reproduce the problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s an example:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"Markdown\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">Update: you can actually reproduce this error with objects:\n\n ```html\n &lt;div *ngFor=\"let value of objs; let i = index\">\n   &lt;input [ngModel]=\"objs[i].v\" (ngModelChange)=\"setObj(i, $event)\" />\n &lt;/div>\n ```\n\n ```js\n export class OneComponent {\n   obj = {v: '0'};\n   objs = [this.obj, this.obj, this.obj, this.obj];\n ​\n  setObj(i: number, value: string) {\n     this.objs[i] = {v: value};\n  }\n }\n ```\n\n The bug is reproducible as long as the trackBy function returns the same value for any two entries in the array. So weird behavior can occur with any duplicate values.\n</code></pre>\n\n\n<h4 id=\"suggest-a-cause\">Suggest a cause</h4>\n\n\n<p>You’re the one who caught the bug, so maybe you can suggest some potential causes for why it&#8217;s there. Maybe the bug only happens after you encounter a certain event, or maybe it only happens on mobile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also can’t hurt to explore the codebase, and maybe identify what’s causing the problem. Then, your Issue will be closed much quicker and you’re likely to be assigned to the related <abbr>PR</abbr>.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"communicating-with-clients\">Communicating with clients</h3>\n\n\n<p>You may work as a solo freelancer, or perhaps you&#8217;re the lead developer on a small team. In either case, let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re responsible for interfacing with clients on a project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, the programmer stereotype is that we&#8217;re poor communicators. We&#8217;ve been known to use overly technical jargon, tell others what is and is not possible, and even get defensive when someone questions our approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, how do we mitigate that stereotype? Ask clients what they want, and always listen to their feedback. Here&#8217;s how to do that.</p>\n\n\n<h4 id=\"ask-the-right-questions\">Ask the right questions</h4>\n\n\n<p>Start by making sure that you and the client are on the same page:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Who is your target audience?</li><li>What is the goal of the site?</li><li>Who is your closest competitor and what are they doing right?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Asking questions is also a good way to write positively, particularly in situations when you disagree with a client&#8217;s feedback or decision. Asking questions forces that person to support their own claims rather than you attacking them by defending your own position:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Are you OK with that even if it comes with an additional performance cost?</li><li>Does moving the component help us better accomplish our objective?</li><li>Great, who is responsible to maintain that after launch?&nbsp;</li><li>Do you know offhand if the contrast between those two colors passes WCAG AA standards?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Questions are a lot more innocent and promote curiosity over animosity.</p>\n\n\n<h4 id=\"sell-yourself\">Sell yourself</h4>\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re making a pitch to a prospective client, you&#8217;re going to need to convince them to hire you. Why should the client choose you? It&#8217;s important to specify the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Who you are</li><li>What you do</li><li>Why you&#8217;re a good fit for the job</li><li>Links to relevant work you&#8217;ve done</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>And once you get the job and need to write up a contract, remember that there&#8217;s no content more intimidating than a bunch of legalese. Even though it&#8217;s written for design projects, the <a href=\"https://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/contract-killer/\" rel=\"noopener\">Contract Killer</a> can be a nice starting point for writing something much friendlier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your attention to detail could be the difference between you and another developer trying to win the same project. In my experience, clients will just as easily hire a develop they think they will enjoy working with than the one who is technically the most competent or experienced for the job.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"writing-microcopy\">Writing microcopy</h3>\n\n\n<p><dfn id=\"microcopy\">Microcopy</dfn> is the art of writing user-friendly <abbr>UI</abbr> messages, such as errors. I&#8217;ll bet there have been times where you as a developer had to write error messages because they were put on the backburner all the way to launch time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That may be why we sometimes see errors like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-none\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">Error: Unexpected input (Code 693)</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Errors are the last thing that you want your users to deal with. But they do happen, and there’s nothing we can do about it. Here are some tips to improve your microcopy skills.</p>\n\n\n<h4 id=\"avoid-technical-jargon\">Avoid technical jargon</h4>\n\n\n<p>Most people don’t know what a server is, while 100% of programmers do. That’s why it’s not unusual to see uncommon terms written in an error message, like <abbr>API</abbr> or &#8220;timeout execution.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unless you&#8217;re dealing with a technical client or user base, It&#8217;s likely that most of your users didn’t take a computer science course, and don’t know how the Internet works, and why a particular thing doesn&#8217;’t work. Hence, the error.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, a good error message shouldn&#8217;t explain <em>why</em> something went wrong, because such explanations might require using scary technical terms. That’s why it’s very important to avoid using technical jargon.</p>\n\n\n<h4 id=\"never-blame-the-user\">Never blame the user</h4>\n\n\n<p>Imagine this: I’m trying to log into your platform. So I open my browser, visit your website, and enter my details. Then I’m told: &#8220;Your email/password is incorrect.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though it seems dramatic to think that this message is hostile, it subconsciously makes me feel stupid. Microcopy says that it’s never okay to blame the user. Try changing your message to something less finger-pointy, like this this example adapted from Mailchimp&#8217;s login: &#8220;Sorry, that email-password combination isn’t right. We can help you recover your account.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"is-style-explanation\">I’d also like to add the importance of avoiding ALL CAPS and exclamation points! Sure, they can be used to convey excitement, but in microcopy they create a sense of hostility towards the user.</p>\n\n\n<h4 id=\"dont-overwhelm-the-user\">Don’t overwhelm the user</h4>\n\n\n<p>Using humor in your microcopy is a good idea! It can lighten up the mood, and it’s an easy way to curb the negativity caused by even the worst errors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you don’t use it <em>perfectly</em>, it can come across as condescending and insulting to the user. That’s just a <em>big</em> risk to take.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://styleguide.mailchimp.com/voice-and-tone/\" rel=\"noopener\">Mailchimp says it well:</a></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>[D]on’t go out of your way to make a joke — forced humor can be worse than none at all. <strong>If you’re unsure, keep a straight face</strong>.</p><cite>(Emphasis mine)</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"writing-accessible-markup\">Writing accessible markup</h3>\n\n\n<p>We could easily spend an entire article about accessibility and how it relates to technical writing. Heck, accessibility is often included in content style guides, including those for <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/accessibility/writing-all-abilities\" rel=\"noopener\">Microsoft</a> and <a href=\"https://styleguide.mailchimp.com/writing-for-accessibility/\" rel=\"noopener\">Mailchimp</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;re a developer and probably already know so much about accessibility. You may even be one of the more diligent developers that makes accessibility a core part of your workflow. Still, it&#8217;s incredible how often accessibility considerations are put on the back burner, no matter how important we all know it is to make accessible online experiences that are inclusive of all abilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if you find yourself implementing someone else&#8217;s copywriting into your code, writing documentation for other developers, or even writing <abbr>UI</abbr> copy yourself, be mindful of some fundamental accessibility best practices, as they round out all the other advice for technical writing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things like:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Using <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/why-how-and-when-to-use-semantic-html-and-aria/\">semantic tags</a> where possible (e.g. <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, etc.)</li><li>Following a logical <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/document-outline-dilemma/\">heading structure</a></li><li>Adding <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/just-how-long-should-alt-text-be/\">alt text</a> to images</li><li>Watching for inline semantics (Mandy Michael has an <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/html-elements-unite-the-voltron-like-powers-of-combining-elements/\">exceptional article on this</a>)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Andy Bell offers some relatively <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/small-tweaks-can-make-huge-impact-websites-accessibility/\">small things you can do to make content more accessible</a>, and it&#8217;s worth your time checking them out. And, just for kicks,<a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/copyediting-with-semantic-html/\"> John Rhea shows off some neat editing tricks</a> that are possible when we&#8217;re working with semantic HTML elements.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\n\n\n<p>Those were six ways that demonstrate how technical writing and development coincide. While the examples and advice may not be rocket science, I hope that you found them useful, whether it&#8217;s collaborating with other developers, maintaining your own work, having to write your own copy in a pinch, or even drafting a project proposal, among other things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bottom line: sharpening your writing skills and putting a little extra effort into your writing can actually make you a better developer.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"technical-writing-resources\">Technical writing resources</h3>\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in technical writing:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/advice-for-technical-writing/\">Advice for Technical Writing</a> (Chris Coyier)</li><li><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/overview\" rel=\"noopener\">Google&#8217;s Technical Writing Guide</a></li><li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/technical-writing/fundamentals/\" rel=\"noopener\">Technical Writing Fundamentals</a> (GitLab)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-writing-study-guide/\" rel=\"noopener\">UX Writing: Study Guide</a> (Nielson Norman Group)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.writethedocs.org/\" rel=\"noopener\">Write the Docs</a> (Technical writing community)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in copywriting:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://copyblogger.com/copywriting-101/\" rel=\"noopener\">Copywriting 101</a> (Copyblogger)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/online-marketing/online-sales/what-is-copywriting/\" rel=\"noopener\">What is Copywriting?</a> (Ionos)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.semrush.com/blog/seo-copywriting/\" rel=\"noopener\">SEO Copywriting</a> Guide (Semrush)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/jan/18/copywritingisstillwriting\" rel=\"noopener\">Copywriting is Still Writin</a>g (The Guardian)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in microcopy:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://uxplanet.org/microcopy-tiny-words-with-a-huge-ux-impact-90140acc6e42?gi=9a63f9a33e8\" rel=\"noopener\">Introduction to Microcopy</a> (UX Planet)</li><li><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/guidelines/overview/\" rel=\"noopener\">Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines</a></li><li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/\" rel=\"noopener\">Microsoft&#8217;s Writing Style Guide</a></li><li><a href=\"https://styleguide.mailchimp.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">Mailchimp Content Style Guide</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in using a professional style guide to improve your writing:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.scribbr.com/mla/formatting/\" rel=\"noopener\">MLA Writing Style Guide</a></li><li><a href=\"https://writer.com/blog/a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-ap-style-of-writing/\" rel=\"noopener\">AP Writing Style Guide</a></li><li><a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/APA_style\" rel=\"noopener\">APA Writing Style Guide</a></li><li><a href=\"https://library.menloschool.org/chicago\" rel=\"noopener\">Chicago Writing Style Guide</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in writing for accessibility:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://piccalil.li/tutorial/improve-the-readability-of-the-content-on-your-website/\" rel=\"noopener\">Improve the readability of the content on your website</a> (Andy Bell)</li><li><a href=\"https://websitesetup.org/web-accessibility-checklist/\" rel=\"noopener\">15 Practices to Improve Your Website Accessibility</a> (Bruce Lawson)</li><li><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/accessibility-testing-tools/\">Accessibility Testing Tools</a> (Chris Coyier)</li><li><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/why-dont-developers-take-accessibility-seriously/\">Why Don&#8217;t Developers Tke Accessibility Seriously?</a> (Melanie Sumner)</li><li><a href=\"https://hidde.blog/naming-things-to-improve-accessibility/?utm_source=CSS-Weekly&amp;utm_campaign=Issue-360&amp;utm_medium=email\" rel=\"noopener\">Naming things to improve accessibility</a> (Hidde de Vries)</li></ul>\n<hr />\n<p><small><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://css-tricks.com/technical-writing-for-developers/\">Technical Writing for Developers</a> originally published on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://css-tricks.com\">CSS-Tricks</a>.

      "content_text": "HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, PHP, C++, Dart — there are so many programming languages out there and you may even be totally fluent in several of them! But as we aim to write more and better code, the way we write and communicate in everyday language becomes more and more important… and perhaps even overlooked.\n\n\n\nThe way we write about and around code is arguably as important as the code itself. And despite where you fall on that line, we can all agree that our words have the potential to both help and hurt code’s effectiveness.\n\n\n\nIn this article, I want to outline how these two seemingly distinct fields — programming and writing — can come together and take our developer skills to the next level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWait, technical writing? Yes, that’s exactly what I mean. I truly believe we are all writers in one sense or another. And I’m here to give you a primer with writing tips, advice, and examples for how it can make you both a better developer and communicator.\n\n\n\nTable of contents\n\n\n\nTable of contents\nTechnical writing is everywhere\nWhat is good grammar?\nWriting code comments\nWriting pull requests \nReporting bugs\nCommunicating with clients\nWriting microcopy\nWriting accessible markup\nConclusion\nTechnical writing resources\n\n\nTechnical writing is everywhere\n\n\nLast year, the team behind the popular Mac Git client, Tower, polled more than 4,000 developers and found that nearly 50% of them spent between 3-6 hours a day writing code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd yes, that’s one survey polling a pretty niche group, but I imagine many of us fall somewhere in that range. Whatever the case, a developer isn’t writing code 24/7, because as this poll suggests, we’re spending plenty of time doing other things.\n\n\n\nThat might include:\n\n\n\ndemoing a new feature,documenting that new feature,updating a work ticket related to that new feature, orbacklogging work to support that new feature.\n\n\n\nOf course, there’s always time for bathroom breaks and Wordle too.\n\n\n\nAnyway, most of the things we typically do involve communicating with people like your team, colleagues, clients, users, and other developers.\n\n\n\nSo we do spend a good chunk of our time communicating with humans through words in addition to the communication we have with computers through code. Words are written language. And if we wrote our words better, we’d communicate better. When we communicate better, we’re more likely to get what we want.\n\n\n\nThat’s Technical Writing 101.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd it doesn’t even end here.. Some programmers also like to make their own products, which means they need to make marketing part of their job. Technical writing plays a huge role in that too. So, yeah. I think it’s pretty fair to say that technical writing is indeed everywhere.\n\n\nWhat is good grammar?\n\n\nWith so many programming languages out there, the last thing we want is to learn another one.\n\n\n\nGrammar is an integral part of English, and it unlocks the full potential of communication. It makes us more formal, professional, and coherent.\n\n\n\nLet me give you a quick rundown on language.\n\n\nThe English syntax\n\n\nJust like programming languages, English has a well-defined syntax, and it starts with words.\n\n\n\nWords are the building blocks of English, and they fall into eight buckets:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNouns\n\n\nThese can be names of people, animals, places, concepts, and objects.\n\n\n\nExample:CSS is one of the core languages of front-end development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerbs\n\n\nVerbs convey action. Even “is” can be considered an action.\n\n\n\nExample:Marcia codes in the morning and answers emails in the afternoon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjectives\n\n\nAdjectives are how we describe nouns. They’re like meta that adds more detail to a sentence to paint a vivid picture.\n\n\n\nExamples:\n\n\n\nCSS is an elegant and poetic language.The HTML for tables is complex and cumbersome.The Box Model is important to understand CSS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrepositions\n\n\nPrepositions create a relationship between a noun and other words, often indicating direction, time, location, and space.\n\n\n\nExamples:\n\n\n\nDid you commit your work to the repo?What is the best approach for this component?We conducted interviews with real users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdverbs\n\n\nSometimes actions need to be more specific, so we use adverbs such as “runs fast” and “compiles slowly.” They often end in “-ly.”\n\n\n\nExamples:\n\n\n\nThis is easily the best idea of them all.Chip waited patiently for Dale’s feedback.The team worked diligently on the project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConjunctions\n\n\nConjunctions connect phrases in a sentence. Remember this classic song from the show School House Rocks?\n\n\n\nExamples:\n\n\n\nCSS for styling while HTML is for markup.Yes, I write code, but I also work on design.That fixes the bug. Yet it introduced a new one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransitions\n\n\nParagraphs are made of sentences that are connected to each other using transitions.\n\n\n\nExamples:\n\n\n\nThere are many programming languages. However, only a few are used in the web industry.First, clone the directory.I like this approach but on the other hand, I know another one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPronouns\n\n\nWhen nouns become repetitive, we replace them with pronouns such as: “he,” “it,” and “that.”\n\n\n\nExamples:\n\n\n\nCSS is a stylesheet language. We use it to style websites.Tony loves to code and he practices every day.Our customers are tech-savvy because they know code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink of these like UI components: they are modular pieces you can move around to construct a complete and robust sentence, the same way you might piece together a complete and robust UI. Do all of the components need to be there all of the time? Certainly not! Assemble a sentence with the pieces you need to complete the experience, just as you would with an interface.\n\n\nVoice and tone\n\n\nVocabulary, punctuation, sentence structure, and word choice. These are all the ingredients of English. We use them to share ideas, communicate with our friends and family, and send emails to our coworkers.\n\n\n\nBut it’s crucial to consider the sound of our messages. It’s amazing how one exclamation point can completely shift the tone of a message:\n\n\n\nI like programming.I like programming! :)\n\n\n\nIt’s easy to confuse voice for tone, and vice versa.\n\n\n\nVoice is what concerns our choice of words, which depends on context. For example, a tutorial for beginners is more likely to use slang and informal language to convey a friendly voice, whereas documentation might be written in a formal, serious, and professional manner in an effort to get straight to the point.\n\n\n\nThe same message, written in two different voices:\n\n\n\nFun: “Expand your social network and stay updated on what’s trending now.”Serious: “Find jobs on one of the largest social networking apps and online jobs market.”\n\n\n\nIt’s not unusual to accidentally write messages that come across as condescending, offensive, and unprofessional. This is where tone comes into play. Read your messages out loud, get other people to read them for you, and experiment with your punctuation and sentence structure. That’s how you hone your tone.\n\n\n\nHere’s another way to think of it: your voice never changes, but your tone does. Your voice is akin to who you are as a person, whereas tone is how you respond in a given situation.\n\n\nActive and passive voice\n\n\nA sentence always contains an actor, a verb, and a target. The order in which these come determines if the sentence is written in an active or passive voice.\n\n\n\nThe actor comes first in an active voice. For example: “CSS paints the background.”\n\n\n\nSentences that use an active voice are more straightforward than their counterparts. They’re clearer, shorter, and more understandable — perfect for a more professional voice that gets straight to the point.\n\n\n\nWith a passive voice, the actor comes last. (See what I did there?) That means our actor — CSS in this case — comes at the end like this: “The background is painted by CSS.”\n\n\n\nReaders usually convert a passive voice to an active voice in their heads, resulting in more processing time. If you’ve ever heard that writing in an active voice is better, this is usually the reason why. Tech writers prefer the active voice most of the time, with very few exceptions such as citing research: “It has been suggested that …”\n\n\n\nBut that doesn’t mean you should always strive for an active voice. Switching from one to the other — even in the same paragraph — can make your content flow more seamlessly from one sentence to another if used effectively.\n\n\nAvoiding mistakes\n\n\nGrammar is all about the structure and correctness of language, and there’s nothing better to achieve that than a quick proofreading of your document. It’s very important to rid your writings of spelling mistakes, grammar issues, and semantic imperfections.\n\n\n\nAt the end of this article, I’ll show you the invaluable tools that professionals use to avoid writing mistakes. Obviously, there are built-in spell checkers in just about everything these days; our code editors even have spell-checking and linting plugins to help prevent mistakes. \n\n\n\nBut if you’re looking for a one-stop tool for all-things grammar, Grammarly is one of the most widely-used tools. I’m not getting a kickback for that or anything. It’s just a really great tool that many editors and writers use to write clean and clear content — similar to how you might use Emmet, eslint, or any other linter to write clean and clear code.\n\n\nWriting code comments\n\n\nThe things we write for other developers can have a big impact on the overall quality of our work, whether it’s what we write in the code, how we explain the code, or how we give feedback on a piece of code.\n\n\n\nIt’s interesting that every programming language comes with a standard set of features to write a comment. They should explain what the code is doing. By that, I don’t mean vague comments like this:\n\n\n\nred *= 1.2 // Multiply `red` by 1.2 and re-assign it\n\n\n\nInstead, use comments that provide more information:\n\n\n\nred *= 1.2 // Apply a 'reddish' effect to the image\n\n\n\nIt’s all about context. “What kind of program am I building?” is exactly the kind of question you should be asking yourself.\n\n\nComments should add value\n\n\nBefore we look at what makes a “good” code comment, here are two examples of lazy comments:\n\n\n\nconst age = 32 // Initialize `age` to 32\n\n\n\nfilter: blur(32px); /* Create a blur effect with a 32px radius */\n\n\n\nRemember that the purpose of a comment is to add value to a piece of code, not to repeat it. If you can’t do that, you’re better off just leaving the code as-is. What makes these examples “lazy” is that they merely restate what the code is obviously doing. In this case, the comments are redundant because they tell us what we already know — they aren’t adding value!\n\n\nComments should reflect the current code\n\n\nOut-of-date comments are no rare sight in large projects; dare I say in most projects.\n\n\n\nLet’s imagine David, a programmer and an all-around cool guy to hang out with. David wants to sort a list of strings alphabetically from A to Z, so he does the obvious in JavaScript:\n\n\n\ncities = sortWords(cities) // sort cities from A to Z\n\n\n\nDavid then realizes that sortWords() actually sorts lists from Z to A. That’s not a problem, as he can simply reverse the output:\n\n\n\ncities = sortWords(cities) // sort cities from A to Z\ncities = reverse(cities)\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, David didn’t update his code comment.\n\n\n\nNow imagine that I didn’t tell you this story, and all you saw was the code above. You’d naturally think that after running that second line of code, `cities` would be sorted from Z to A! This whole confusion fiasco was caused by a stale comment.\n\n\n\nWhile this might be an exaggerated example, something similar can (and often does) happen if you’re racing against a close deadline. Thankfully, this can be prevented by following one simple rule… change your comments the same time you change the code.\n\n\n\nThat’s one simple rule that will save you and your team from a lot of technical debt.\n\n\n\nNow that we know what poorly written comments look like, let’s look at some good examples.\n\n\nComments should explain unidiomatic code\n\n\nSometimes, the natural way of doing things isn’t right. Programmers might have to “break” the standards a bit, but when they do, it’s advisable to leave a little comment explaining their rationale:\n\n\n\n function addSetEntry(set, value) {    \n  /* Don't return `set.add` because it's not chainable in IE 11. */  \n  set.add(value);\n  return set;\n}\n\n\n\nThat’s helpful, right? If you were responsible for reviewing this code, you may have been tempted to correct it without that comment there explaining what’s up.\n\n\nComments can identify future tasks\n\n\nAnother useful thing to do with comments is to admit that there’s more work to be done.\n\n\n\n// TODO: use a more efficient algorithm\nlinearSort(ids)\n\n\n\nThis way, you can stay focused on your flow. And at a later date, you (or someone else) can come back and fix it.\n\n\nComments can link back to the source\n\n\nSo, you just found a solution to your problem on StackOverflow. After copy-pasting that code, it’s sometimes a good thing to keep a link to the answer that helped you out so you can come back to it for future reference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n// Adds handling for legacy browsers\n// https://stackoverflow.com/a/XXXXXXX\n\n\n\nThis is important because solutions can change. It’s always good to know where your code came from in case it ever breaks.\n\n\nWriting pull requests \n\n\nPull requests (PRs) are a fundamental aspect of any project. They sit at the heart of code reviews. And code reviews can quickly become a bottleneck in your team’s performance without good wording.\n\n\n\nA good PR description summarizes what change is being made and why it’s being made. Large projects have a pull request template, like this one adapted from a real example:\n\n\n\n## Proposed changes\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request.\n\n## Types of changes\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Appium?\n - [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\n - [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\n - ...\n\n## Checklist\n - [ ] I have read the CONTRIBUTING doc\n - [ ] I have signed the CLA\n - [ ] Lint and unit tests pass locally with my changes\n\n## Further comments\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc…\n\n\nAvoid vague PR titles\n\n\nPlease avoid titles that look like this:\n\n\n\nFix build.Fix bug.Add patch.\n\n\n\nThese don’t even attempt to describe what build, bug, or patch it is we’re dealing with. A little extra detail on what part of the build was fixed, which bug was squashed, or what patch was added can go a long way to establishing better communication and collaboration with your colleagues. It level-sets and gets folks on the same page.\n\n\n\nPR titles are traditionally written in imperative tense. They’re a one-line summary of the entire PR, and they should describe what is being done by the PR.\n\n\n\nHere are some good examples:\n\n\n\nSupport custom srcset attributes in NgOptimizedImageDefault image config to 75% image qualityAdd explicit selectors for all built-in ControlValueAccessors\n\n\nAvoid long PRs\n\n\nA large PR means a huge description, and no one wants to review hundreds or thousands of lines of code, sometimes just to end-up dismissing the whole thing!\n\n\n\nInstead, you could:\n\n\n\ncommunicate with your team through Issues,make a plan,break down the problem into smaller pieces, orwork on each piece separately with its own PR.\n\n\n\nIsn’t it much cleaner now?\n\n\nProvide details in the PR body\n\n\nUnlike the PR title, the body is the place for all the details, including:\n\n\n\nWhy is the PR being done?Why is this the best approach?Any shortcomings to the approach, and ideas to solve them if possibleThe bug or ticket number, benchmark results, etc.\n\n\nReporting bugs\n\n\nBug reports are one of the most important aspects of any project. And all great projects are built on user feedback. Usually, even after countless tests, it’s the users that find most bugs. Users are also great idealists, and sometimes they have feature ideas; please listen to them!\n\n\n\nFor technical projects, all of this stuff is done by reporting issues. A well-written issue is easy for another developer to find and respond to.\n\n\n\nFor example, most big projects come with a template:\n\n\n\n <!-- Modified from angular-translate/angular-translate -->\n ### Subject of the issue\n Describe your issue here.\n\n ### Your environment\n * version of angular-translate\n * version of angular\n * which browser and its version\n\n ### Steps to reproduce\n Tell us how to reproduce this issue.\n\n ### Expected behavior\n Tell us what should happen.\n\n ### Actual behavior\n Tell us what happens instead.\n\n\nGather screenshots\n\n\nCapture the issue using your system’s screen-shooting utility.\n\n\n\nIf it’s a screenshot of a CLI program, make sure that the text is clear. If it’s a UI program, make sure the screenshot captures the right elements and states.\n\n\n\nYou may need to capture an actual interaction to demonstrate the issue. If that’s the case, try to record GIFs using a screen-recording tool.\n\n\nHow to reproduce the problem\n\n\nIt’s much easier for programmers to solve a bug when it’s live on their computer. That’s why a good commit message should come with the steps to precisely reproduce the problem.\n\n\n\nHere’s an example:\n\n\n\nUpdate: you can actually reproduce this error with objects:\n\n ```html\n <div *ngFor=\"let value of objs; let i = index\">\n   <input [ngModel]=\"objs[i].v\" (ngModelChange)=\"setObj(i, $event)\" />\n </div>\n ```\n\n ```js\n export class OneComponent {\n   obj = {v: '0'};\n   objs = [this.obj, this.obj, this.obj, this.obj];\n ​\n  setObj(i: number, value: string) {\n     this.objs[i] = {v: value};\n  }\n }\n ```\n\n The bug is reproducible as long as the trackBy function returns the same value for any two entries in the array. So weird behavior can occur with any duplicate values.\n\n\n\nSuggest a cause\n\n\nYou’re the one who caught the bug, so maybe you can suggest some potential causes for why it’s there. Maybe the bug only happens after you encounter a certain event, or maybe it only happens on mobile.\n\n\n\nIt also can’t hurt to explore the codebase, and maybe identify what’s causing the problem. Then, your Issue will be closed much quicker and you’re likely to be assigned to the related PR.\n\n\nCommunicating with clients\n\n\nYou may work as a solo freelancer, or perhaps you’re the lead developer on a small team. In either case, let’s say you’re responsible for interfacing with clients on a project. \n\n\n\nNow, the programmer stereotype is that we’re poor communicators. We’ve been known to use overly technical jargon, tell others what is and is not possible, and even get defensive when someone questions our approach.\n\n\n\nSo, how do we mitigate that stereotype? Ask clients what they want, and always listen to their feedback. Here’s how to do that.\n\n\nAsk the right questions\n\n\nStart by making sure that you and the client are on the same page:\n\n\n\nWho is your target audience?What is the goal of the site?Who is your closest competitor and what are they doing right?\n\n\n\nAsking questions is also a good way to write positively, particularly in situations when you disagree with a client’s feedback or decision. Asking questions forces that person to support their own claims rather than you attacking them by defending your own position:\n\n\n\nAre you OK with that even if it comes with an additional performance cost?Does moving the component help us better accomplish our objective?Great, who is responsible to maintain that after launch? Do you know offhand if the contrast between those two colors passes WCAG AA standards?\n\n\n\nQuestions are a lot more innocent and promote curiosity over animosity.\n\n\nSell yourself\n\n\nIf you’re making a pitch to a prospective client, you’re going to need to convince them to hire you. Why should the client choose you? It’s important to specify the following:\n\n\n\nWho you areWhat you doWhy you’re a good fit for the jobLinks to relevant work you’ve done\n\n\n\nAnd once you get the job and need to write up a contract, remember that there’s no content more intimidating than a bunch of legalese. Even though it’s written for design projects, the Contract Killer can be a nice starting point for writing something much friendlier.\n\n\n\nYour attention to detail could be the difference between you and another developer trying to win the same project. In my experience, clients will just as easily hire a develop they think they will enjoy working with than the one who is technically the most competent or experienced for the job.\n\n\nWriting microcopy\n\n\nMicrocopy is the art of writing user-friendly UI messages, such as errors. I’ll bet there have been times where you as a developer had to write error messages because they were put on the backburner all the way to launch time.\n\n\n\nThat may be why we sometimes see errors like this:\n\n\n\nError: Unexpected input (Code 693)\n\n\n\nErrors are the last thing that you want your users to deal with. But they do happen, and there’s nothing we can do about it. Here are some tips to improve your microcopy skills.\n\n\nAvoid technical jargon\n\n\nMost people don’t know what a server is, while 100% of programmers do. That’s why it’s not unusual to see uncommon terms written in an error message, like API or “timeout execution.”\n\n\n\nUnless you’re dealing with a technical client or user base, It’s likely that most of your users didn’t take a computer science course, and don’t know how the Internet works, and why a particular thing doesn’’t work. Hence, the error.\n\n\n\nTherefore, a good error message shouldn’t explain why something went wrong, because such explanations might require using scary technical terms. That’s why it’s very important to avoid using technical jargon.\n\n\nNever blame the user\n\n\nImagine this: I’m trying to log into your platform. So I open my browser, visit your website, and enter my details. Then I’m told: “Your email/password is incorrect.”\n\n\n\nEven though it seems dramatic to think that this message is hostile, it subconsciously makes me feel stupid. Microcopy says that it’s never okay to blame the user. Try changing your message to something less finger-pointy, like this this example adapted from Mailchimp’s login: “Sorry, that email-password combination isn’t right. We can help you recover your account.”\n\n\n\nI’d also like to add the importance of avoiding ALL CAPS and exclamation points! Sure, they can be used to convey excitement, but in microcopy they create a sense of hostility towards the user.\n\n\nDon’t overwhelm the user\n\n\nUsing humor in your microcopy is a good idea! It can lighten up the mood, and it’s an easy way to curb the negativity caused by even the worst errors.\n\n\n\nBut if you don’t use it perfectly, it can come across as condescending and insulting to the user. That’s just a big risk to take.\n\n\n\nMailchimp says it well:\n\n\n\n[D]on’t go out of your way to make a joke — forced humor can be worse than none at all. If you’re unsure, keep a straight face.(Emphasis mine)\n\n\nWriting accessible markup\n\n\nWe could easily spend an entire article about accessibility and how it relates to technical writing. Heck, accessibility is often included in content style guides, including those for Microsoft and Mailchimp.\n\n\n\nYou’re a developer and probably already know so much about accessibility. You may even be one of the more diligent developers that makes accessibility a core part of your workflow. Still, it’s incredible how often accessibility considerations are put on the back burner, no matter how important we all know it is to make accessible online experiences that are inclusive of all abilities.\n\n\n\nSo, if you find yourself implementing someone else’s copywriting into your code, writing documentation for other developers, or even writing UI copy yourself, be mindful of some fundamental accessibility best practices, as they round out all the other advice for technical writing.\n\n\n\nThings like:\n\n\n\nUsing semantic tags where possible (e.g. <nav>, <header>, <article>, etc.)Following a logical heading structureAdding alt text to imagesWatching for inline semantics (Mandy Michael has an exceptional article on this)\n\n\n\nAndy Bell offers some relatively small things you can do to make content more accessible, and it’s worth your time checking them out. And, just for kicks, John Rhea shows off some neat editing tricks that are possible when we’re working with semantic HTML elements.\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nThose were six ways that demonstrate how technical writing and development coincide. While the examples and advice may not be rocket science, I hope that you found them useful, whether it’s collaborating with other developers, maintaining your own work, having to write your own copy in a pinch, or even drafting a project proposal, among other things.\n\n\n\nThe bottom line: sharpening your writing skills and putting a little extra effort into your writing can actually make you a better developer.\n\n\nTechnical writing resources\n\n\nIf you’re interested in technical writing:\n\n\n\nAdvice for Technical Writing (Chris Coyier)Google’s Technical Writing GuideTechnical Writing Fundamentals (GitLab)UX Writing: Study Guide (Nielson Norman Group)Write the Docs (Technical writing community)\n\n\n\nIf you’re interested in copywriting:\n\n\n\nCopywriting 101 (Copyblogger)What is Copywriting?

We can use a conic gradient with CSS <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/c/clip-path/\"><code>clip-path</code></a> on the element’s <code>::before</code> and <code>::after</code> pseudos to simulate the three visible faces of a 3D cube. Negative margin is what pulls the two pseudos together to overlap and simulate a full cube. The rest of our work is mostly animating those two halves to get neat-looking loaders!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s check out a visual that explains the math behind the clip-path points used to create this cube-like element:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"727\" height=\"330\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/s_9ECD86875806C309CB49F8B7F67E643AAA9F5765A5BB414A6BF99C36B8B2AD15_1654638629737_image.png?resize=727%2C330&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-366546\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/s_9ECD86875806C309CB49F8B7F67E643AAA9F5765A5BB414A6BF99C36B8B2AD15_1654638629737_image.png?w=727&amp;ssl=1 727w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/s_9ECD86875806C309CB49F8B7F67E643AAA9F5765A5BB414A6BF99C36B8B2AD15_1654638629737_image.png?resize=300%2C136&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We have our variables and an equation, so let’s put those to work. First, we’ll establish our variables and set the sizing for the main <code>.loader</code> element:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.loader {\n  --s: 150px; /* control the size */\n  --_d: calc(0.353 * var(--s)); /* 0.353 = sin(45deg)/2 */\n\n  width: calc(var(--s) + var(--_d)); \n  aspect-ratio: 1;\n  display: flex;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Nothing too crazy so far. We have a <code>150px</code> square that’s set up as a flexible container. Now we establish our pseudos:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.loader::before,\n.loader::after {\n  content: \"\";\n  flex: 1;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Those are two halves in the <code>.loader</code> container. We need to paint them in, so that’s where our <a href=\"http://\">conic gradient</a> kicks in:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"6-7\"><code markup=\"tt\">.loader::before,\n.loader::after {\n  content: \"\";\n  flex: 1;\n  background:\n    conic-gradient(from -90deg at calc(100% - var(--_d)) var(--_d),\n    #fff 135deg, #666 0 270deg, #aaa 0);\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The gradient is there, but <a href=\"https://codepen.io/t_afif/pen/XWZLqpN/d03664aee9db90a47ae492f5be068840\" rel=\"noopener\">it looks weird</a>. We need to <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/c/clip-path/\">clip it to the element</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.loader::before,\n.loader::after {\n  content: \"\";\n  flex: 1;\n  background:\n    conic-gradient(from -90deg at calc(100% - var(--_d)) var(--_d),\n    #fff 135deg, #666 0 270deg, #aaa 0);\n  clip-path:\n    polygon(var(--_d) 0, 100% 0, 100% calc(100% - var(--_d)), calc(100% - var(--_d)) 100%, 0 100%, 0 var(--_d));\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s make sure the two halves overlap with a <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/m/margin/#aa-negative-margins\">negative margin</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.loader::before {\n  margin-right: calc(var(--_d) / -2);\n}\n\n.loader::after {\n  margin-left: calc(var(--_d) / -2);\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Now let’s make ‘em move!</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.loader::before,\n.loader::after {\n  /* same as before */\n  animation: load 1.5s infinite cubic-bezier(0, .5, .5, 1.8) alternate;\n}\n\n.loader::after {\n  /* same as before */\n  animation-delay: -.75s\n}\n\n@keyframes load{\n  0%, 40%   { transform: translateY(calc(var(--s) / -4)) }\n  60%, 100% { transform: translateY(calc(var(--s) / 4)) }\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s the final demo once again:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_BawVzmx\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/BawVzmx?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=BawVzmx&amp;default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed BawVzmx\" title=\"CodePen Embed BawVzmx\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"the-progress-cube-loader\">The progress cube loader</h3>\n\n\n<p>Let’s use the same technique to create a 3D progress loader. Yes, still only one element!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_yLvPvjJ\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/yLvPvjJ?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=yLvPvjJ&amp;default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed yLvPvjJ\" title=\"CodePen Embed yLvPvjJ\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re not changing a thing as far as simulating the cube the same way we did before, other than changing the loader’s height and aspect ratio. The animation we’re making relies on a surprisingly easy technique where we update the width of the left side while the right side fills the remaining space, thanks to <code>flex-grow: 1</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step is to add some transparency to the right side using <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/o/opacity/\"><code>opacity</code></a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_abqaRJY\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/abqaRJY?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=abqaRJY&amp;default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed abqaRJY\" title=\"CodePen Embed abqaRJY\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\n\n\n\n<p>This simulates the effect that one side of the cube is filled in while the other is empty. Then we update the color of the left side. To do that, we either update the three colors inside the conic gradient or we do it by adding a background color with a <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/background-blend-mode/\"><code>background-blend-mode</code></a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.loader::before {\n  background-color: #CC333F; /* control the color here */\n  background-blend-mode: multiply;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>This trick only allows us to update the color only once. The right side of the loader blends in with the three shades of white from the conic gradient to create three new shades of our color, even though we’re only using one color value. Color trickery!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_KKQxGqN\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/KKQxGqN?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=KKQxGqN&amp;default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed KKQxGqN\" title=\"CodePen Embed KKQxGqN\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s animate the width of the loader’s left side:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_rNJZqzY\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/rNJZqzY?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=rNJZqzY&amp;default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed rNJZqzY\" title=\"CodePen Embed rNJZqzY\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Oops, the animation is a bit strange at the beginning! Notice how it sort of starts outside of the cube? This is because we’re starting the animation at the <code>0%</code> width. But due to the <code>clip-path</code> and negative margin we’re using, what we need to do instead is start from our <code>--_d</code> variable, which we used to define the <code>clip-path</code> points and the negative margin:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"3\"><code markup=\"tt\">@keyframes load {\n  0%,\n  5% {width: var(--_d); }\n  95%,\n  100% {width: 100%; }\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s a little better:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_zYRJmER\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/zYRJmER?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=zYRJmER&amp;default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed zYRJmER\" title=\"CodePen Embed zYRJmER\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\n\n\n\n<p>But we can make this animation even smoother. Did you notice we’re missing a little something? Let me show you a screenshot to compare what the final demo should look like with that last demo:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_9ECD86875806C309CB49F8B7F67E643AAA9F5765A5BB414A6BF99C36B8B2AD15_1654640494288_image.png\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s the bottom face of the cube! Since the second element is transparent, we need to see the bottom face of that rectangle as you can see in the left example. It’s subtle, but should be there!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can add a gradient to the main element and clip it like we did with the pseudos:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">background: linear-gradient(#fff1 0 0) bottom / 100% var(--_d) no-repeat;</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s the full code once everything is pulled together:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.loader {\n  --s: 100px; /* control the size */\n  --_d: calc(0.353*var(--s)); /* 0.353 = sin(45deg) / 2 */\n\n  height: var(--s); \n  aspect-ratio: 3;\n  display: flex;\n  background: linear-gradient(#fff1 0 0) bottom / 100% var(--_d) no-repeat;\n  clip-path: polygon(var(--_d) 0, 100% 0, 100% calc(100% - var(--_d)), calc(100% - var(--_d)) 100%, 0 100%, 0 var(--_d));\n}\n.loader::before,\n.loader::after {\n  content: \"\";\n  clip-path: inherit;\n  background:\n    conic-gradient(from -90deg at calc(100% - var(--_d)) var(--_d),\n     #fff 135deg, #666 0 270deg, #aaa 0);\n}\n.loader::before {\n  background-color: #CC333F; /* control the color here */\n  background-blend-mode: multiply;\n  margin-right: calc(var(--_d) / -2);\n  animation: load 2.5s infinite linear;\n}\n.loader:after {\n  flex: 1;\n  margin-left: calc(var(--_d) / -2);\n  opacity: 0.4;\n}\n\n@keyframes load {\n  0%,\n  5% { width: var(--_d); }\n  95%,\n  100% { width: 100%; }\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_yLvPvjJ\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/yLvPvjJ?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=yLvPvjJ&amp;default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed yLvPvjJ\" title=\"CodePen Embed yLvPvjJ\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s it! We just used a clever technique that uses pseudo-elements, conic gradients, clipping, background blending, and negative margins to get, not one, but <em>two</em> sweet-looking 3D loaders with nothing more than a single element in the markup.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"more-3d\">More 3D</h3>\n\n\n<p>We can still go further and simulate an infinite number of 3D cubes using one element — yes, it’s possible! Here’s a grid of cubes:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_PoJeqwN\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/PoJeqwN?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=PoJeqwN&amp;default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed PoJeqwN\" title=\"CodePen Embed PoJeqwN\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"is-style-explanation\">This demo and the following demos are unsupported in Safari at the time of writing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Crazy, right? Now we’re creating a repeated pattern of cubes made using a single element… and no pseudos either! I won’t go into fine detail about the math we are using (there are very specific numbers in there) but here is a figure to visualize how we got here:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"794\" height=\"373\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/s_98F21CD3C1C7899779F98C6C3E6075E37A8E660CF4703968B4D3A7A973FF0FA6_1651672139054_image.png?resize=794%2C373&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-366547\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/s_98F21CD3C1C7899779F98C6C3E6075E37A8E660CF4703968B4D3A7A973FF0FA6_1651672139054_image.png?w=794&amp;ssl=1 794w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/s_98F21CD3C1C7899779F98C6C3E6075E37A8E660CF4703968B4D3A7A973FF0FA6_1651672139054_image.png?resize=300%2C141&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/s_98F21CD3C1C7899779F98C6C3E6075E37A8E660CF4703968B4D3A7A973FF0FA6_1651672139054_image.png?resize=768%2C361&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We first use a <code>conic-gradient</code> to create the repeating cube pattern. The repetition of the pattern is controlled by three variables:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><code>--size</code>: True to its name, this controls the size of each cube.</li><li><code>--m</code>: This represents the number of columns.</li><li><code>--n</code>: This is the number of rows.</li><li><code>--gap</code>: this the gap or distance between the cubes</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.cube {\n  --size: 40px; \n  --m: 4; \n  --n: 5;\n  --gap :10px;\n\n  aspect-ratio: var(--m) / var(--n);\n  width: calc(var(--m) * (1.353 * var(--size) + var(--gap)));\n  background:\n    conic-gradient(from -90deg at var(--size) calc(0.353 * var(--size)),\n      #249FAB 135deg, #81C5A3 0 270deg, #26609D 0) /* update the colors here */\n    0 0 / calc(100% / var(--m)) calc(100% / var(--n));\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Then we apply a mask layer using another pattern having the same size. This is the trickiest part of this idea. Using a combination of a <code>linear-gradient</code> and a <code>conic-gradient</code> we will cut a few parts of our element to keep only the cube shapes visible.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.cube {\n  /* etc. */\n  mask: \n    linear-gradient(to bottom right,\n       #0000 calc(0.25 * var(--size)),\n       #000 0 calc(100% - calc(0.25 * var(--size)) - 1.414 * var(--gap)),\n       #0000 0),\n    conic-gradient(from -90deg at right var(--gap) bottom var(--gap), #000 90deg, #0000 0);  \n  mask-size: calc(100% / var(--m)) calc(100% / var(--n));\n  mask-composite: intersect;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The code may look a bit complex but thanks to CSS variables all we need to do is to update a few values to control our matrix of cubes. Need a 10⨉10 grid? Update the <code>--m</code> and <code>--n</code> variables to <code>10</code>. Need a wider gap between cubes? Update the <code>--gap</code> value. The color values are only used once, so update those for a new color palette!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we have another 3D technique, let’s use it to build variations of the loader by playing around with different animations. For example, how about a repeating pattern of cubes sliding infinitely from left to right?</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_gOvdQRg\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/gOvdQRg?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=gOvdQRg&amp;default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed gOvdQRg\" title=\"CodePen Embed gOvdQRg\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\n\n\n\n<p>This loader defines four cubes in a single row.

In other words, we no longer need these!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, we can work with the <code>--size</code> and <code>--gap</code> variables in a grid container:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.loader {\n  --size: 70px;\n  --gap: 15px;  \n\n  width: calc(3 * (1.353 * var(--size) + var(--gap)));\n  display: grid;\n  aspect-ratio: 3;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>This is our container. We have four cubes, but only want to show three in the container at a time so that we always have one sliding in as one is sliding out. That’s why we are factoring the width by <code>3</code> and have the aspect ratio set to <code>3</code> as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s make sure that our cube pattern is set up for the width of four cubes.

      "content_text": "For this fourth and final article of our little series on single-element loaders, we are going to explore 3D patterns. When creating a 3D element, it’s hard to imagine that just one HTML element is enough to simulate something like all six faces of a cube. But  maybe we can get away with something more cube-like instead by showing only the front three sides of the shape — it’s totally possible and that’s what we’re going to do together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle series\n\n\nSingle Element Loaders: The SpinnerSingle Element Loaders: The DotsSingle Element Loaders: The BarsSingle Element Loaders: Going 3D — you are here\n\n\n\nThe split cube loader\n\n\nHere is a 3D loader where a cube is split into two parts, but is only made with only a single element:\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nEach half of the cube is made using a pseudo-element:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCool, right?! We can use a conic gradient with CSS clip-path on the element’s ::before and ::after pseudos to simulate the three visible faces of a 3D cube. Negative margin is what pulls the two pseudos together to overlap and simulate a full cube. The rest of our work is mostly animating those two halves to get neat-looking loaders!\n\n\n\nLet’s check out a visual that explains the math behind the clip-path points used to create this cube-like element:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have our variables and an equation, so let’s put those to work. First, we’ll establish our variables and set the sizing for the main .loader element:\n\n\n\n.loader {\n  --s: 150px; /* control the size */\n  --_d: calc(0.353 * var(--s)); /* 0.353 = sin(45deg)/2 */\n\n  width: calc(var(--s) + var(--_d)); \n  aspect-ratio: 1;\n  display: flex;\n}\n\n\n\nNothing too crazy so far. We have a 150px square that’s set up as a flexible container. Now we establish our pseudos:\n\n\n\n.loader::before,\n.loader::after {\n  content: \"\";\n  flex: 1;\n}\n\n\n\nThose are two halves in the .loader container. We need to paint them in, so that’s where our conic gradient kicks in:\n\n\n\n.loader::before,\n.loader::after {\n  content: \"\";\n  flex: 1;\n  background:\n    conic-gradient(from -90deg at calc(100% - var(--_d)) var(--_d),\n    #fff 135deg, #666 0 270deg, #aaa 0);\n}\n\n\n\nThe gradient is there, but it looks weird. We need to clip it to the element:\n\n\n\n.loader::before,\n.loader::after {\n  content: \"\";\n  flex: 1;\n  background:\n    conic-gradient(from -90deg at calc(100% - var(--_d)) var(--_d),\n    #fff 135deg, #666 0 270deg, #aaa 0);\n  clip-path:\n    polygon(var(--_d) 0, 100% 0, 100% calc(100% - var(--_d)), calc(100% - var(--_d)) 100%, 0 100%, 0 var(--_d));\n}\n\n\n\nLet’s make sure the two halves overlap with a negative margin:\n\n\n\n.loader::before {\n  margin-right: calc(var(--_d) / -2);\n}\n\n.loader::after {\n  margin-left: calc(var(--_d) / -2);\n}\n\n\n\nNow let’s make ‘em move!\n\n\n\n.loader::before,\n.loader::after {\n  /* same as before */\n  animation: load 1.5s infinite cubic-bezier(0, .5, .5, 1.8) alternate;\n}\n\n.loader::after {\n  /* same as before */\n  animation-delay: -.75s\n}\n\n@keyframes load{\n  0%, 40%   { transform: translateY(calc(var(--s) / -4)) }\n  60%, 100% { transform: translateY(calc(var(--s) / 4)) }\n}\n\n\n\nHere’s the final demo once again:\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\nThe progress cube loader\n\n\nLet’s use the same technique to create a 3D progress loader. Yes, still only one element!\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nWe’re not changing a thing as far as simulating the cube the same way we did before, other than changing the loader’s height and aspect ratio. The animation we’re making relies on a surprisingly easy technique where we update the width of the left side while the right side fills the remaining space, thanks to flex-grow: 1.\n\n\n\nThe first step is to add some transparency to the right side using opacity:\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nThis simulates the effect that one side of the cube is filled in while the other is empty. Then we update the color of the left side. To do that, we either update the three colors inside the conic gradient or we do it by adding a background color with a background-blend-mode:\n\n\n\n.loader::before {\n  background-color: #CC333F; /* control the color here */\n  background-blend-mode: multiply;\n}\n\n\n\nThis trick only allows us to update the color only once. The right side of the loader blends in with the three shades of white from the conic gradient to create three new shades of our color, even though we’re only using one color value. Color trickery!\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nLet’s animate the width of the loader’s left side:\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nOops, the animation is a bit strange at the beginning! Notice how it sort of starts outside of the cube? This is because we’re starting the animation at the 0% width. But due to the clip-path and negative margin we’re using, what we need to do instead is start from our --_d variable, which we used to define the clip-path points and the negative margin:\n\n\n\n@keyframes load {\n  0%,\n  5% {width: var(--_d); }\n  95%,\n  100% {width: 100%; }\n}\n\n\n\nThat’s a little better:\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nBut we can make this animation even smoother. Did you notice we’re missing a little something? Let me show you a screenshot to compare what the final demo should look like with that last demo:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s the bottom face of the cube! Since the second element is transparent, we need to see the bottom face of that rectangle as you can see in the left example. It’s subtle, but should be there!\n\n\n\nWe can add a gradient to the main element and clip it like we did with the pseudos:\n\n\n\nbackground: linear-gradient(#fff1 0 0) bottom / 100% var(--_d) no-repeat;\n\n\n\nHere’s the full code once everything is pulled together:\n\n\n\n.loader {\n  --s: 100px; /* control the size */\n  --_d: calc(0.353*var(--s)); /* 0.353 = sin(45deg) / 2 */\n\n  height: var(--s); \n  aspect-ratio: 3;\n  display: flex;\n  background: linear-gradient(#fff1 0 0) bottom / 100% var(--_d) no-repeat;\n  clip-path: polygon(var(--_d) 0, 100% 0, 100% calc(100% - var(--_d)), calc(100% - var(--_d)) 100%, 0 100%, 0 var(--_d));\n}\n.loader::before,\n.loader::after {\n  content: \"\";\n  clip-path: inherit;\n  background:\n    conic-gradient(from -90deg at calc(100% - var(--_d)) var(--_d),\n     #fff 135deg, #666 0 270deg, #aaa 0);\n}\n.loader::before {\n  background-color: #CC333F; /* control the color here */\n  background-blend-mode: multiply;\n  margin-right: calc(var(--_d) / -2);\n  animation: load 2.5s infinite linear;\n}\n.loader:after {\n  flex: 1;\n  margin-left: calc(var(--_d) / -2);\n  opacity: 0.4;\n}\n\n@keyframes load {\n  0%,\n  5% { width: var(--_d); }\n  95%,\n  100% { width: 100%; }\n}\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nThat’s it! We just used a clever technique that uses pseudo-elements, conic gradients, clipping, background blending, and negative margins to get, not one, but two sweet-looking 3D loaders with nothing more than a single element in the markup.\n\n\nMore 3D\n\n\nWe can still go further and simulate an infinite number of 3D cubes using one element — yes, it’s possible! Here’s a grid of cubes:\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nThis demo and the following demos are unsupported in Safari at the time of writing.\n\n\n\nCrazy, right? Now we’re creating a repeated pattern of cubes made using a single element… and no pseudos either! I won’t go into fine detail about the math we are using (there are very specific numbers in there) but here is a figure to visualize how we got here:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe first use a conic-gradient to create the repeating cube pattern. The repetition of the pattern is controlled by three variables:\n\n\n\n--size: True to its name, this controls the size of each cube.--m: This represents the number of columns.--n: This is the number of rows.--gap: this the gap or distance between the cubes\n\n\n\n.cube {\n  --size: 40px; \n  --m: 4; \n  --n: 5;\n  --gap :10px;\n\n  aspect-ratio: var(--m) / var(--n);\n  width: calc(var(--m) * (1.353 * var(--size) + var(--gap)));\n  background:\n    conic-gradient(from -90deg at var(--size) calc(0.353 * var(--size)),\n      #249FAB 135deg, #81C5A3 0 270deg, #26609D 0) /* update the colors here */\n    0 0 / calc(100% / var(--m)) calc(100% / var(--n));\n}\n\n\n\nThen we apply a mask layer using another pattern having the same size. This is the trickiest part of this idea. Using a combination of a linear-gradient and a conic-gradient we will cut a few parts of our element to keep only the cube shapes visible.\n\n\n\n.cube {\n  /* etc. */\n  mask: \n    linear-gradient(to bottom right,\n       #0000 calc(0.25 * var(--size)),\n       #000 0 calc(100% - calc(0.25 * var(--size)) - 1.414 * var(--gap)),\n       #0000 0),\n    conic-gradient(from -90deg at right var(--gap) bottom var(--gap), #000 90deg, #0000 0);  \n  mask-size: calc(100% / var(--m)) calc(100% / var(--n));\n  mask-composite: intersect;\n}\n\n\n\nThe code may look a bit complex but thanks to CSS variables all we need to do is to update a few values to control our matrix of cubes. Need a 10⨉10 grid? Update the --m and --n variables to 10. Need a wider gap between cubes? Update the --gap value. The color values are only used once, so update those for a new color palette!\n\n\n\nNow that we have another 3D technique, let’s use it to build variations of the loader by playing around with different animations. For example, how about a repeating pattern of cubes sliding infinitely from left to right?\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nThis loader defines four cubes in a single row. That means our --n value is 4 and --m is equal to 1 . In other words, we no longer need these!\n\n\n\nInstead, we can work with the --size and --gap variables in a grid container:\n\n\n\n.loader {\n  --size: 70px;\n  --gap: 15px;  \n\n  width: calc(3 * (1.353 * var(--size) + var(--gap)));\n  display: grid;\n  aspect-ratio: 3;\n}\n\n\n\nThis is our container. We have four cubes, but only want to show three in the container at a time so that we always have one sliding in as one is sliding out. That’s why we are factoring the width by 3 and have the aspect ratio set to 3 as well.\n\n\n\nLet’s make sure that our cube pattern is set up for the width of four cubes. We’re going to do this on the container’s ::before pseudo-element:\n\n\n\n.loader::before { \n  content: \"\";\n  width: calc(4 * 100% / 3);\n  /*\n     Code to create four cubes\n  */\n}\n\n\n\nNow that we have four cubes in a three-cube container, we can justify the cube pattern to the end of the grid container to overflow it, showing the last three cubes:\n\n\n\n.loader {\n  /* same as before */\n  justify-content: end;\n}\n\n\n\nHere’s what we have so far, with a red outline to show the bounds of the grid container:\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nNow all we have to do is to move the pseudo-element to the right by adding our animation:\n\n\n\n@keyframes load {\n  to { transform: translate(calc(100% / 4)); }\n}\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nDid you get the trick of the animation? Let’s finish this off by hiding the overflowing cube pattern and by adding a touch of masking to create that fading effect that the start and the end:\n\n\n\n.loader {\n  --size: 70px;\n  --gap: 15px;  \n  \n  width: calc(3*(1.353*var(--s) + var(--g)));\n  display: grid;\n  justify-items: end;\n  aspect-ratio: 3;\n  overflow: hidden;\n  mask: linear-gradient(90deg, #0000, #000 30px calc(100% - 30px), #0000);\n}\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nWe can make this a lot more flexible by introducing a variable, --n, to set how many cubes are displayed in the container at once. And since the total number of cubes in the pattern should be one more than --n, we can express that as calc(var(--n) + 1).\n\n\n\nHere’s the full thing:\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nOK, one more 3D loader that’s similar but has the cubes changing color in succession instead of sliding:\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nWe’re going to rely on an animated background with background-blend-mode for this one:\n\n\n\n.loader {\n  /* ... */\n  background:\n    linear-gradient(#ff1818 0 0) 0% / calc(100% / 3) 100% no-repeat,\n    /* ... */;\n  background-blend-mode: multiply;\n  /* ... */\n  animation: load steps(3) 1.5s infinite;\n}\n@keyframes load {\n  to { background-position: 150%; }\n}\n\n\n\nI’ve removed the superfluous code used to create the same layout as the last example, but with three cubes instead of four. What I am adding here is a gradient defined with a specific color that blends with the conic gradient, just as we did earlier for the progress bar 3D loader.\n\n\n\nFrom there, it’s animating the background gradient’s background-position as a three-step animation to make the cubes blink colors one at a time.\n\n\n\nIf you are not familiar with the values I am using for background-position and the background syntax, I highly recommend one of my previous articles and one of my Stack Overflow answers. You will find a very detailed explanation there.\n\n\n\nCan we update the number of cubes to make it variables?\n\n\n\nYes, I do have a solution for that, but I’d like you to take a crack at it rather than embedding it here. Take what we have learned from the previous example and try to do the same with this one — then share your work in the comments!\n\n\nVariations galore!\n\n\nLike the other three articles in this series, I’d like to leave you with some inspiration to go forth and create your own loaders. Here is a collection that includes the 3D loaders we made together, plus a few others to get your imagination going:\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\nThat’s a wrap\n\n\nI sure do hope you enjoyed spending time making single element loaders with me these past few weeks. It’s crazy that we started with seemingly simple spinner and then gradually added new pieces to work ourselves all the way up to 3D techniques that still only use a single element in the markup. This is exactly what CSS looks like when we harness its powers: scalable, flexible, and reusable.\n\n\n\nThanks again for reading this little series! I’ll sign off by reminding you that I have a collection of more than 500 loaders if you’re looking for more ideas and inspiration.\n\n\n\nArticle series\n\n\nSingle Element Loaders: The SpinnerSingle Element Loaders: The DotsSingle Element Loaders: The BarsSingle Element Loaders: Going 3D — you are here\n\n\nSingle Element Loaders: Going 3D! originally published on CSS-Tricks.

I&#8217;ll go through some real-world examples with you to illustrate my points, and in the end, hopefully, you&#8217;ll be better equipped than me when I first had to choose an animation library.</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-366509\"></span>\n\n\n\n<p>Your mileage with this advice may vary, of course. Everything I&#8217;m sharing here is specific to a thing I wanted to build. Your project may have completely different requirements and priorities and that&#8217;s OK. I think what&#8217;s important here is getting a first-hand account of <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/how-to-think-like-a-front-end-developer/\">thinking like a front-end developer</a> with a particular goal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of which, I do consider myself a front-end developer but my background is super heavy in design. So I know code, but not to the extent of someone who is a JavaScript engineer. Just wanted to clear that up because experience can certainly impact the final decision.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"heres-the-goal\"><strong>Here&#8217;s the goal</strong></h3>\n\n\n<p>Before we get into any decision-making let&#8217;s take a look at the sorts of animations I needed to make in this CSS-Tricks-ified version of the game:</p>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"solitaire_embed\" style=\"width:100%;margin-block-end: 1.5rem;\">\n  <style>\n    @media (max-width: 800px) {\n      #solitaire_embed > div {\n        padding-bottom: 90% !important; /* Change aspect ratio on mobile */\n      }\n    }\n    @media (max-width: 568px) {\n      #solitaire_embed > div {\n        padding-bottom: 100% !important; /* Change aspect ratio on mobile */\n      }\n    }\n    @media (max-width: 414px) {\n      #solitaire_embed > div {\n        padding-bottom: 120% !important; /* Change aspect ratio on mobile */\n      }\n    }\n  </style>\n  <div style=\"position:relative;padding-bottom:75%;border-radius:6px;overflow:hidden;\">\n    <iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;border:0px;\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" allowfullscreen=\"false\" src=\"https://online-solitaire.com/css-tricks\" title=\"Play Klondike (Turn 3) and many more Solitaire games at online-solitaire.com\"></iframe>\n    <div style=\"position:absolute;width:100%;height:100%;top:0px;left:0px;pointer-events:none;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 1px rgba(0,0,0,0.25);border-radius:6px;\"></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Pretty sweet, right? There&#8217;s nothing exactly trivial about these animations. There&#8217;s a lot going on — sometimes simultaneously — and a lot to orchestrate. Plus, a majority of the animations are triggered by user interactions. So, that left me with a few priorities heading into my decision:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Smooth animations:</strong> The way animations are applied can have a big impact on whether they run smoothly, or display a little choppiness.</li><li><strong>Performance:</strong> Adopting any library is going to add weight to a project and I wanted my game to be as lean as possible.</li><li><strong>Convenience:</strong> I wanted a nice, clean syntax that makes it easier to write and manage the animations. I&#8217;d even trade a little extra convenience for a small performance cost if it allows me to write better, more maintainable code. Again, this bodes well for a designer-turned-developer.</li><li><strong>Browser support:</strong> Of course I wanted my game to work on any modern browser using some form of progressive enhancement to prevent completely borking legacy browsers. Plus, I definitely wanted&nbsp; some future-proofing.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s what I took with me as I went in search of the right tool for this particular job.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"choosing-between-css-or-javascript-animation-libraries\"><strong>Choosing between CSS or JavaScript</strong> animation libraries</h3>\n\n\n<p>The first thing I considered when choosing an animation library was whether to go with a CSS or JavaScript-based library. There are lots of <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/css-animation-libraries/\">great CSS libraries</a>, many of them with excellent performance which was a high priority for me. I was looking to do some heavy-duty animations, like the&nbsp; ability to sequence animations and get callbacks on animation completion. That&#8217;s all totally possible with pure CSS — still, it&#8217;s a lot less smooth than what most JavaScript libraries offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s see how a simple sequenced animation looks in CSS and compare it to jQuery, which has plenty of built-in animation helpers:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_BaYbWJQ\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/BaYbWJQ?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=BaYbWJQ&amp;default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed BaYbWJQ\" title=\"CodePen Embed BaYbWJQ\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The animations look the same but are created differently. To make the CSS animation, first, we have to define the keyframe animation in our CSS and attach it to a class:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.card.move {\n  animation : move 2s;\n}\n\n@keyframes move {\n  0% { left: 0 }\n  50% { left: 100px }\n  100% { left: 0 }\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>We then execute the animation using JavaScript and listen for a CSS callback on the element:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"jQuery\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">var cardElement = document.getElementsByClassName(\"card\")[0];\nvar statusElement = document.getElementsByClassName(\"status\")[0];\n\ncardElement.classList.add(\"move\");\nstatusElement.innerHTML = \"Animating\"\n\nvar animationEndCallback = function() {\n  cardElement.classList.remove(\"move\");\n  statusElement.innerHTML = \"Inactive\"\n}\n\ncardElement.addEventListener(\"webkitAnimationEnd\", animationEndCallback);\ncardElement.addEventListener(\"oAnimationEnd\", animationEndCallback); \ncardElement.addEventListener(\"antionend\", animationEndCallback);</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Having things happen in different places might be fine in a simple example like this, but it can become very confusing once things get a bit more complex.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compare this to how the animation is done with jQuery:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"jQuery\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">$(\".status\").text(\"Animating\")\n$( \".card\" ).animate({\n  left: \"100px\"\n}, 1000);\n$( \".card\" ).animate({\n  left: 0\n}, 1000, function() {\n  $(\".status\").text(\"Inactive\")\n});</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, everything happens in the same place, simplifying things should the animations grow more complex in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It seemed clear that a JavaScript library was the right way to go, but which was the right one to choose for my Solitaire game? I mean, jQuery is great and <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/js-jquery\" rel=\"noopener\">still widely used even today</a>, but that&#8217;s not something I want to hang my hat on. There are plenty of JavaScript animation libraries, so I wanted to consider something built specifically to handle the type of heavy animations I had in mind.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"choosing-a-javascript-animation-library\"><strong>Choosing a JavaScript animation library</strong></h3>\n\n\n<p>It quickly became apparent to me that there&#8217;s no lack of JavaScript animation libraries and <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/comparison-animation-technologies/\">new, exciting technologies</a>. They all have benefits and drawbacks, so let&#8217;s go through some of the ones I considered and why.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API\" rel=\"noopener\">Web Animations API </a>is one such case that might replace many JavaScript animation libraries in the future. With it, you&#8217;ll be able to create complex staggered animations without loading any external libraries and with the same performance as CSS animations. The only drawback is that <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/#feat=web-animation\" rel=\"noopener\">not all browsers support it yet</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element presents another exciting opportunity. In it, we can animate things with JavaScript, as we would with the DOM, but the animation is rendered as raster, which means we can make some high-performance animations. The only drawback is that the canvas element is essentially rendered as an image in the DOM, so if we&#8217;re looking for pixel-perfection, we might be out of luck. As someone acutely in tune with design, this was a dealbreaker for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I needed something tried and tested, so I knew I probably had to go with one of the many JavaScript libraries. I started looking at libraries and narrowed my choices to <a href=\"https://animejs.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">Anime.js</a> and <a href=\"https://greensock.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">GSAP</a>. They both seemed to handle complex animations well and had excellent notes on performance. Anime is a well-maintained library with over 42.000 stars on GitHub, while GSAP is a super popular, battle-tested library with a thriving community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An active community was critical to me since I needed a place to ask for help, and I didn&#8217;t want to use a library that might later be abandoned. I considered this as part of my convenience requirements.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"sequencing-animations-and-callbacks\"><strong>Sequencing animations and callbacks</strong></h3>\n\n\n<p>Once I had my choices narrowed down, the next step was to implement a complex animation using my two libraries. A recurrent animation in a solitaire game is that of a card moving somewhere and then turning over, so let&#8217;s see how that looks:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_ExQMXzQ\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/ExQMXzQ?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=ExQMXzQ&amp;default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed ExQMXzQ\" title=\"CodePen Embed ExQMXzQ\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Both animations look great! They&#8217;re smooth, and implementing both of them was pretty straightforward. Both libraries had a <a href=\"https://animejs.com/documentation/#timelineBasics\" rel=\"noopener\">timeline function</a> that made creating sequences a breeze. This is how the implementation looks in AnimeJS:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">var timeline = anime.timeline({\n  begin: function() {\n    $(\".status\").text(\"Animating\")\n  },\n  complete: function() {\n    $(\".status\").text(\"Inactive\")\n  }\n});\n\ntimeline.add({\n  targets: '.card',\n  left: [0, 300],\n  easing: 'easeInOutSine',\n  duration: 500\n}).add({\n  targets: '.card .back',\n  rotateY: [0, 90],\n  easing: 'easeInSine',\n  duration: 200\n}).add({\n  targets: '.card .front',\n  rotateY: [-90, 0],\n  easing: 'easeOutSine',\n  duration: 200\n})</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Anime&#8217;s <a href=\"https://animejs.com/documentation/#timelineBasics\" rel=\"noopener\"><code>timeline()</code> function</a> comes built-in with callbacks on beginning and ending the animation, and creating the sequence is as easy as appending the sequential animations. First, I move the card, then I turn my back-image 90 degrees, so it goes out of view, and then I turn my front-image 90 degrees, so it comes into view.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same implementation using GSAP&#8217;s <a href=\"https://greensock.com/get-started/#sequencing-with-timelines\" rel=\"noopener\"><code>timeline()</code> function</a> looks very similar:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">var timeline = gsap.timeline({\n  onStart: function() {\n    $(\".status\").text(\"Animating\")\n  },\n  onComplete: function() {\n    $(\".status\").text(\"Inactive\")\n  }\n});\n\ntimeline.fromTo(\".card\", {\n  left: 0\n}, {\n  duration: 0.5,\n  left: 300\n}).fromTo(\".card .back\", {\n  rotationY: 0\n}, {\n  rotationY: 90,\n  ease: \"power1.easeIn\",\n  duration: 0.2\n}).fromTo(\".card .front\", {\n  rotationY: -90\n}, {\n  rotationY: 0,\n  ease: \"power1.easeOut\",\n  duration: 0.2\n})</code></pre>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"decision-time\"><strong>Decision time</strong></h3>\n\n\n<p>The main difference between Anime and GSAP appears to be the syntax, where GSAP might be a little more elaborate. I was stuck with two great libraries that had very similar functionality, were able to deal with complex animation, and had a thriving community. It seemed like I had a tie race!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Priority</strong></td><td><strong>Anime</strong></td><td><strong>GSAP</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Smooth animations</td><td>&#x2705;</td><td>&#x2705;</td></tr><tr><td>Performance</td><td>&#x2705;</td><td>&#x2705;</td></tr><tr><td>Convenience</td><td>&#x2705;</td><td>&#x2705;</td></tr><tr><td>Browser support</td><td>&#x2705;</td><td>&#x2705;</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what made me choose one library over the other?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was very concerned about how the library would act under pressure. Having laggy animations in a game like Solitaire can greatly impact how fun it is to play the game. I knew I wouldn&#8217;t be able to fully see how the library performed before I created the game. Luckily, GSAP had made a <a href=\"https://greensock.com/js/speed.html\" rel=\"noopener\">stress test</a> that compared different animation libraries to each other, including Anime.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_DrPzmR\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/DrPzmR?height=650&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=DrPzmR&amp;default-tab=result\" height=\"650\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed DrPzmR\" title=\"CodePen Embed DrPzmR\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking at that, GSAP certainly looked to be the superior library for dealing with loads of complex animations. GSAP was giving me upwards of 26 frames per second on a heavy animation that Anime was only able to top out at 19.  After reading up on GSAP more and looking into their forums, it became clear that performance was of the highest priority to the guys behind GSAP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And even though both GSAP and Anime have been around a while, Anime&#8217;s repo has been sitting somewhat dormant a couple of years while GSAP had made commits in the past couple of months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I ended up using GSAP and haven&#8217;t regretted my decision!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How about you? Does any of this square with how you evaluate and compare front-end tooling? Are there other priorities you might have considered (e.g. accessibility, etc.) in a project like this? Or do you have a project where you had to pare down your choices from a bunch of different options? Please share in the comments because I&#8217;d like to know!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, and if you want to see how it looks when animating a whole deck of cards, you can head over to my site and <a href=\"https://online-solitaire.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">play a game of Solitaire</a>.

As someone acutely in tune with design, this was a dealbreaker for me.\n\n\n\nI needed something tried and tested, so I knew I probably had to go with one of the many JavaScript libraries. I started looking at libraries and narrowed my choices to Anime.js and GSAP. They both seemed to handle complex animations well and had excellent notes on performance. Anime is a well-maintained library with over 42.000 stars on GitHub, while GSAP is a super popular, battle-tested library with a thriving community.\n\n\n\nAn active community was critical to me since I needed a place to ask for help, and I didn’t want to use a library that might later be abandoned. I considered this as part of my convenience requirements.\n\n\nSequencing animations and callbacks\n\n\nOnce I had my choices narrowed down, the next step was to implement a complex animation using my two libraries. A recurrent animation in a solitaire game is that of a card moving somewhere and then turning over, so let’s see how that looks:\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nBoth animations look great! They’re smooth, and implementing both of them was pretty straightforward. Both libraries had a timeline function that made creating sequences a breeze. This is how the implementation looks in AnimeJS:\n\n\n\nvar timeline = anime.timeline({\n  begin: function() {\n    $(\".status\").text(\"Animating\")\n  },\n  complete: function() {\n    $(\".status\").text(\"Inactive\")\n  }\n});\n\ntimeline.add({\n  targets: '.card',\n  left: [0, 300],\n  easing: 'easeInOutSine',\n  duration: 500\n}).add({\n  targets: '.card .back',\n  rotateY: [0, 90],\n  easing: 'easeInSine',\n  duration: 200\n}).add({\n  targets: '.card .front',\n  rotateY: [-90, 0],\n  easing: 'easeOutSine',\n  duration: 200\n})\n\n\n\nAnime’s timeline() function comes built-in with callbacks on beginning and ending the animation, and creating the sequence is as easy as appending the sequential animations. First, I move the card, then I turn my back-image 90 degrees, so it goes out of view, and then I turn my front-image 90 degrees, so it comes into view.\n\n\n\nThe same implementation using GSAP’s timeline() function looks very similar:\n\n\n\nvar timeline = gsap.timeline({\n  onStart: function() {\n    $(\".status\").text(\"Animating\")\n  },\n  onComplete: function() {\n    $(\".status\").text(\"Inactive\")\n  }\n});\n\ntimeline.fromTo(\".card\", {\n  left: 0\n}, {\n  duration: 0.5,\n  left: 300\n}).fromTo(\".card .back\", {\n  rotationY: 0\n}, {\n  rotationY: 90,\n  ease: \"power1.easeIn\",\n  duration: 0.2\n}).fromTo(\".card .front\", {\n  rotationY: -90\n}, {\n  rotationY: 0,\n  ease: \"power1.easeOut\",\n  duration: 0.2\n})\n\n\nDecision time\n\n\nThe main difference between Anime and GSAP appears to be the syntax, where GSAP might be a little more elaborate. I was stuck with two great libraries that had very similar functionality, were able to deal with complex animation, and had a thriving community. It seemed like I had a tie race!\n\n\n\nPriorityAnimeGSAPSmooth animations✅✅Performance✅✅Convenience✅✅Browser support✅✅\n\n\n\nSo, what made me choose one library over the other?\n\n\n\nI was very concerned about how the library would act under pressure. Having laggy animations in a game like Solitaire can greatly impact how fun it is to play the game. I knew I wouldn’t be able to fully see how the library performed before I created the game. Luckily, GSAP had made a stress test that compared different animation libraries to each other, including Anime.\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nLooking at that, GSAP certainly looked to be the superior library for dealing with loads of complex animations. GSAP was giving me upwards of 26 frames per second on a heavy animation that Anime was only able to top out at 19.  After reading up on GSAP more and looking into their forums, it became clear that performance was of the highest priority to the guys behind GSAP.\n\n\n\nAnd even though both GSAP and Anime have been around a while, Anime’s repo has been sitting somewhat dormant a couple of years while GSAP had made commits in the past couple of months.\n\n\n\nI ended up using GSAP and haven’t regretted my decision!\n\n\n\nHow about you? Does any of this square with how you evaluate and compare front-end tooling? Are there other priorities you might have considered (e.g. accessibility, etc.) in a project like this? Or do you have a project where you had to pare down your choices from a bunch of different options? Please share in the comments because I’d like to know! \n\n\n\nOh, and if you want to see how it looks when animating a whole deck of cards, you can head over to my site and play a game of Solitaire.

So, rather than dropping in code snippets throughout the book, what you&#8217;ll find are details about code strategies, such as progressive enhancement, deciding on what tooling to use, and the challenges of writing future-friendly code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for those of you who have not had the pleasure of listening to Jeremy narrate content (like he does in the <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/category/history/\">Web History series</a>), there&#8217;s an audio file available to download.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-72 wp-block-buttons\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link\" href=\"https://resilientwebdesign.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">Direct link</a></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<h4 id=\"beginning-css-web-development-from-novice-to-professional-by-simon-collison\"><em>Beginning CSS Web Development: From Novice to Professional</em> by Simon Collison</h4>\n\n\n<ul class=\"is-style-almanac-list\"><li><strong>Perfect for:</strong> The fundamentals of CSS</li><li><strong>Learning level:</strong> Absolute beginners</li><li><strong>Requires:</strong> Nothing but time and motivation</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It may be written in 2006, but Simon&#8217;s coverage of web standards and accessibility is timeless and relevant today. He provides an understanding of interoperability as well as approaches for building web applications, including the early planning phases that often go overlooked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The book has two broad parts which are further divided into 16 chapters. Part 1 covers CSS topics, like working with text, links, lists, backgrounds, images, tables, and forms. It really doesn&#8217;t skimp on the details either.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part 2 is all about layout, shedding light on usability and layout manipulation, plus a handy case study. The chapters are arranged in such a way that one chapter naturally flows into the next. Each chapter also contains a concluding section that highlights all the important concepts covered in the chapter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, the book provides novice developers a solid background in CSS and helps them gradually with more advanced concepts. It will make your CSS journey easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-73 wp-block-buttons\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link\" href=\"https://archive.org/details/beginningcsswebd0000coll/page/n9/mode/2up\" rel=\"noopener\">Direct link</a></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"books-on-html-amp-css\">Books on HTML &amp; CSS</h3>\n\n\n<p>CSS and HTML are often taught together, which can be especially helpful when you&#8217;re writing your first lines of code and want to know how the two languages interact with one another.</p>\n\n\n<h4 id=\"learn-to-code-html-amp-css-by-shay-howe\"><em>Learn to Code HTML &amp; CSS</em> by Shay Howe</h4>\n\n\n<ul class=\"is-style-almanac-list\"><li><strong>Perfect for:</strong> Starting your front-end journey</li><li><strong>Learning level:</strong> Beginners</li><li><strong>Requires:</strong> No prior experience at all</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Shay refers to this book as a <q>simple and comprehensive guide dedicated to helping beginners learn HTML and CSS.</q> He does this by focusing on common elements of front-end design and development.

In the first chapter *Building Your First Web Page, Shay analyzed the contents of a typical website including elements, attributes and setting up the HTML document structure, code validation, selectors and CSS resets. I find the book very instructive especially as it went beyond the surface to address many key concepts with code samples, which you can follow along.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One profound thing about this great book is that, Shay built a complete project from scratch throughout the 12 lessons and at the end of each lesson, he provided a summary and links to the current state of that website (so you can compare with yours if you follow along) and the source code at every stage of the lessons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re a learner who learns by doing, you will find this material very useful and by the time you&#8217;re done, you will have developed a multi page functional website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An advanced sequel of the course is also available free via the same link.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-74 wp-block-buttons\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link\" href=\"https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/\" rel=\"noopener\">Direct link</a></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<h4 id=\"html-amp-css-learn-the-fundamentals-in-7-days-by-michael-knapp\"><em>HTML &amp; CSS: Learn the Fundamentals in 7 Days</em> by Michael Knapp</h4>\n\n\n<ul class=\"is-style-almanac-list\"><li><strong>Perfect for:</strong> Starting your front-end journey</li><li><strong>Learning level:</strong> Beginners</li><li><strong>Requires:</strong> No prior experience at all</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Can you possibly learn everything there is to know about the HTML and CSS in seven days?

In fact, <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/javascript-learning-landscape-2018/\">Jason Rodriguez wrote about the JavaScript learning landscape in 2018</a> and provided a nice list of free books. Not too much has cropped up since then, but here are my thoughts on the following books.</p>\n\n\n<h4 id=\"eloquent-javascript-by-marijn-haverbeke\"><em>Eloquent JavaScript</em> by Marijn Haverbeke</h4>\n\n\n<ul class=\"is-style-almanac-list\"><li><strong>Perfect for:</strong> Getting better at writing JavaScript</li><li><strong>Learning level:</strong> Intermediate to seasoned developers</li><li><strong>Requires:</strong> Prior JavaScript experience</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Eloquent JavaScript</em> really lives up to its name. Personally, I consider this one of the best-written JavaScript books I have ever come across. Marjin&#8217;s writing style is engaging, especially with how he introduces programming concepts and carries the reader along. In his words, the book is simply about <q>instructing computers and making them do what you want them to do.</q></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The book is a deep dive into JavaScript spread across three parts and 21 chapters. You&#8217;re going to read a bunch about basic programming concepts, such as values, types, operators and functions, to advanced concepts like regular expressions, modules, the DOM, and asynchronous programming. He starts every chapter with a somewhat philosophical quote to prepare the reader for what lies ahead and then dives straight into the topic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, there&#8217;s three projects to help you practice your newfound skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-81 wp-block-buttons\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link\" href=\"https://eloquentjavascript.net/\" rel=\"noopener\">Direct link</a></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<h4 id=\"understanding-javascript-promises-by-nicholas-c-zakas\"><em>Understanding JavaScript Promises</em> by Nicholas C.

Although the <a href=\"https://ebooks.humanwhocodes.com/promises\" rel=\"noopener\">link to the book we&#8217;re providing</a> is the free community version, the full version (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09RTNGFZ1/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_WN8VCYEZ5A5ZT6PCBHBA?tag=nczonline-20&amp;geniuslink=true\" rel=\"noopener\">available on Amazon</a>) has two more chapters on Async Functions and Unhandled Rejection Tracking. Nicholas simplified the concept of Promises with several illustrations and examples. You will learn how to use <code>then()</code>, <code>catch()</code>, and <code>finally()</code> and understand how to chain multiple promises together. Nicholas also covers the assignment of rejection and settlement handlers. You may want to give the book a read to solidify your understanding of the topic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nicholas is a veteran JavaScript book author who has been writing about JavaScript for over 15 years.

These are things even stump some seasoned CSSers, some of these concepts might be confusing. Adam has gone to a great length to demystify each.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the book being a great primer on complex CSS concepts, I love how each of the CSS properties mentioned throughout the book is clickable so you can always click on them to see how each is applied. There are many illustrative examples and recommendations for further reading, should you desire to learn more about each chapter.\n\n\n\nI found the chapter on colors very interesting not only because it gets into the best practices for using color accessibly, but also because there’s super practical applications, like when Adam gets into using CSS to support an organization’s branding.\n\n\n\n\nDirect link\n\n\n\nResilient Web Design by Jeremy Keith\n\n\nPerfect for: Developing strategies for writing codeLearning level: IntermediateRequires: Some basic understanding of CSS\n\n\n\nStraight from the introduction:\n\n\n\nYou won’t find any code in here to help you build better websites.

So, rather than dropping in code snippets throughout the book, what you’ll find are details about code strategies, such as progressive enhancement, deciding on what tooling to use, and the challenges of writing future-friendly code.\n\n\n\nAnd for those of you who have not had the pleasure of listening to Jeremy narrate content (like he does in the Web History series), there’s an audio file available to download.\n\n\n\n\nDirect link\n\n\n\nBeginning CSS Web Development: From Novice to Professional by Simon Collison\n\n\nPerfect for: The fundamentals of CSSLearning level: Absolute beginnersRequires: Nothing but time and motivation\n\n\n\nIt may be written in 2006, but Simon’s coverage of web standards and accessibility is timeless and relevant today. He provides an understanding of interoperability as well as approaches for building web applications, including the early planning phases that often go overlooked.\n\n\n\nThe book has two broad parts which are further divided into 16 chapters. Part 1 covers CSS topics, like working with text, links, lists, backgrounds, images, tables, and forms. It really doesn’t skimp on the details either.\n\n\n\nPart 2 is all about layout, shedding light on usability and layout manipulation, plus a handy case study. The chapters are arranged in such a way that one chapter naturally flows into the next. Each chapter also contains a concluding section that highlights all the important concepts covered in the chapter.\n\n\n\nIndeed, the book provides novice developers a solid background in CSS and helps them gradually with more advanced concepts. It will make your CSS journey easier.\n\n\n\n\nDirect link\n\n\n\nBooks on HTML & CSS\n\n\nCSS and HTML are often taught together, which can be especially helpful when you’re writing your first lines of code and want to know how the two languages interact with one another.\n\n\nLearn to Code HTML & CSS by Shay Howe\n\n\nPerfect for: Starting your front-end journeyLearning level: BeginnersRequires: No prior experience at all\n\n\n\nShay refers to this book as a simple and comprehensive guide dedicated to helping beginners learn HTML and CSS. He does this by focusing on common elements of front-end design and development. Some of the lessons covered are Box Model, Positioning, Typography, Background and Gradients, Lists, Media, Forms, and Tables. In the first chapter *Building Your First Web Page, Shay analyzed the contents of a typical website including elements, attributes and setting up the HTML document structure, code validation, selectors and CSS resets. I find the book very instructive especially as it went beyond the surface to address many key concepts with code samples, which you can follow along.\n\n\n\nOne profound thing about this great book is that, Shay built a complete project from scratch throughout the 12 lessons and at the end of each lesson, he provided a summary and links to the current state of that website (so you can compare with yours if you follow along) and the source code at every stage of the lessons.\n\n\n\nIf you’re a learner who learns by doing, you will find this material very useful and by the time you’re done, you will have developed a multi page functional website.\n\n\n\nAn advanced sequel of the course is also available free via the same link.\n\n\n\n\nDirect link\n\n\n\nHTML & CSS: Learn the Fundamentals in 7 Days by Michael Knapp\n\n\nPerfect for: Starting your front-end journeyLearning level: BeginnersRequires: No prior experience at all\n\n\n\nCan you possibly learn everything there is to know about the HTML and CSS in seven days? Probably not, but that’s why this 2017 book by Michael Knapp is focused straight on the fundamentals. Michael delves into a brief history lesson before launching into HTML and CSS structure, logic, and presentation. You’re going to get all up to speed to the point where you should feel pretty confident about putting a basic webpage together, plus a few extras along the way as the book touches on SEO and analytics.\n\n\n\nThe book is comprised of simple programs that you can run on your computer if you wish to follow along.\n\n\n\nThe ebook version is available for free on Apple Books, but there is a Kindle version as well if you already have a subscription there.\n\n\n\n\nApple Books\n\n\n\nKindle\n\n\n\nThe Greatest CSS Tricks Vol. 1 by Chris Coyier\n\n\nPerfect for: Marveling at what CSS can doLearning level: IntermediateRequires: Some CSS experience\n\n\n\nDid you know that CSS-Tricks has a book on CSS too? It would be silly to leave that off this list because what you get is a collection of classic CSS trickery that’s explained by none other than Chris Coyier. In fact, Chris handpicked all of the examples covered in the book from his many, many (many!) years running this here site from the plentitude of tricks that have crossed his desk.\n\n\n\nEach trick solves a particular pain point. For instance, the first “Pin Scrolling to Bottom” trickdemonstrates how the overflow-anchor CSS property can be used to create the same chat-like interface of a tool like Slack, where the screen is anchored at the bottom in a way that feels as though the page is scrolling for you as new items are added.\n\n\n\n\nDirect Link\n\n\n\nBooks on process\n\n\nCode is just as much about how we write code and collaborate on projects with others as it is about the actual code we write. The following books are great starting points for everything from planning and project management to communicating and collaborating with others.\n\n\nCollaborate: Bring People Together Around Digital Projects by Ellen De Vries\n\n\nPerfect for: Being a better collaboratorLearning level: N/ARequires: An open mind to working well with others!\n\n\n\nEllen addresses something in this book that we all have to deal with: collaborating with others. And it’s no small deal — the book is divided into four parts that go super deep into things we can go to work well with others:\n\n\n\nKnow how to prepare the ground and create the right conditions for collaboration.Nurture the group culture in the early stages of collaboration.Maintain a healthy collaborative process.Reap the rewards of a collaboration.\n\n\n\nAs a content strategist, Ellen has the right kind of experience to help anyone be part of a collaborative project, or get the most from a collaboration.\n\n\n\n\nDirect link\n\n\n\nThe Modern Web Design Process by webflow\n\n\nPerfect for: Senior designers, project managersLearning level: N/ARequires: Some basic understanding of CSS\n\n\n\nThis free ebook features a seven-step design process that’s meant to help define the workflow for today’s brand of web design.\n\n\n\nThat includes:\n\n\n\nSetting goalsDefining scopeSitemaps and wireframesWorking with contentHandling visual elementsTestingShipping\n\n\n\nAnyone starting a new design project or in the middle of a design project will find the invaluable insights throughout the book. And what’s most remarkable is how this is written in a way that almost feels as though you are being hand-held through an entire project from concept to completion.\n\n\n\n\nDirect link\n\n\n\nDesigning for the Web by Mark Boulton\n\n\nPerfect for: Learning to work with clientsLearning level: BeginnersRequires: A genuine interest in design\n\n\n\nIt seems many organizations tackle design differently. But author Mark Boulton documents a thorough design workflow in Designing for the Web that de-mystifies many challenges and covers everything you need to know.\n\n\n\nWhat’s unique about this book is that it’s really about work. Sure, there’s a bunch of hugely valuable information on design best practices for things like typography, color, and layout, but what you’re really going to take away from this book is how these fit into a design workflow. It teaches you how to research, the technologies we have to implement ideas, and ultimately, how to work with others as well as clients — perfect fodder for folks including design leads, project managers, freelancers, or anyone who’s involved in the project delivery process.\n\n\n\n\nDirect Link\n\n\n\nLearn Version Control with Git by Tower\n\n\nPerfect for: Mastering GitLearning level: All levels welcomeRequires: No prior knowledge at all\n\n\n\nIn this book, the team behind the popular Tower client for Git introduce learners to the crux of version control system using Git. Developers who work in teams will particularly find this very useful, as it helps in effectively collaborating with team members building different features of a project even when you’re thousands of miles apart. That said, it’s still really great for anyone who might be shy of the command line and wants to build confidence there.\n\n\n\nAnd since the book is by the maker of an application that interacts with Git, you’re going to get a nice dose of using Tower as a GUI in addition to working directly on the command line.\n\n\n\nSo, whether it’s committing, branching, merging, pull requests, forking work, or handling merge conflicts, you’re going to get a whole lot from this book.\n\n\n\n\nDirect Link\n\n\n\nBooks on JavaScript\n\n\nLearning JavaScript always seems to be en vogue. In fact, Jason Rodriguez wrote about the JavaScript learning landscape in 2018 and provided a nice list of free books. Not too much has cropped up since then, but here are my thoughts on the following books.\n\n\nEloquent JavaScript by Marijn Haverbeke\n\n\nPerfect for: Getting better at writing JavaScriptLearning level: Intermediate to seasoned developersRequires: Prior JavaScript experience\n\n\n\nEloquent JavaScript really lives up to its name. Personally, I consider this one of the best-written JavaScript books I have ever come across. Marjin’s writing style is engaging, especially with how he introduces programming concepts and carries the reader along. In his words, the book is simply about instructing computers and making them do what you want them to do.\n\n\n\nThe book is a deep dive into JavaScript spread across three parts and 21 chapters. You’re going to read a bunch about basic programming concepts, such as values, types, operators and functions, to advanced concepts like regular expressions, modules, the DOM, and asynchronous programming. He starts every chapter with a somewhat philosophical quote to prepare the reader for what lies ahead and then dives straight into the topic.\n\n\n\nPlus, there’s three projects to help you practice your newfound skills.\n\n\n\n\nDirect link\n\n\n\nUnderstanding JavaScript Promises by Nicholas C. Zakas\n\n\nPerfect for: Those who want to learn all about asynchronous programming with promises in JavaScript.Learning level: IntermediateRequires: Basic JavaScript chops\n\n\n\nJavaScript promises were introduced in 2015 as part of the ES6 specification to handle asynchronous functions in JavaScript. According to MDN:\n\n\n\nA promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation\n\n\n\nIn this 51-page book, Nicholas explains the concept of Promises over three chapters: Basics, Chaining Promises, and Working with Multiple Promises. Although the link to the book we’re providing is the free community version, the full version (available on Amazon) has two more chapters on Async Functions and Unhandled Rejection Tracking. Nicholas simplified the concept of Promises with several illustrations and examples. You will learn how to use then(), catch(), and finally() and understand how to chain multiple promises together. Nicholas also covers the assignment of rejection and settlement handlers. You may want to give the book a read to solidify your understanding of the topic.\n\n\n\nNicholas is a veteran JavaScript book author who has been writing about JavaScript for over 15 years. He brings his wealth of experience to bear in this book (just as he has in his work here at CSS-Tricks).\n\n\n\n\nDirect link\n\n\n\nSpeaking JavaScript by Axel Rauschmayer\n\n\nPerfect for: Leveling up from beginning JavaScriptLearning level: IntermediateRequires: Knowledge of object oriented programming\n\n\n\nThis book is presented in four chapters covering more than 30 topics. Here’s how it breaks down:\n\n\n\nThe first chapter is a nice refresher on syntax, variable types, functions and exception handling.The second chapter offers historical perspective into JavaScript as a prelude for the types of features covered throughout the rest of the book.Chapter 3 is presented as more or less a reference book with short, clean examples.The final chapter outlines tips, tools and libraries to help write better JavaScript and follow best practices.\n\n\n\n\nDirect Link\n\n\n\nSecrets of the JavaScript Ninja by John Resig and Bear Bibeault\n\n\nPerfect for: Creating a cross-browser JavaScript library from the ground upLearning level: IntermediateRequires: Some prior programming experience\n\n\n\nThere’s actually a newer edition of this book, but the 2012 edition is the one that’s free. Either way, it’s a good opportunity to learn from John Resig; you know, the guy who created jQuery.\n\n\n\nThe techniques covered here include closures, functions, the DOM, object orientation with prototypes, and cross-browser strategies. One nice perk is that each chapter is followed by a brief recap that’s perfect for a reference once you’ve finished the book.\n\n\n\n\nDirect Link\n\n\n\nLearning JavaScript Design Patterns by Addy Osmani\n\n\nPerfect for: Learning to write more efficient JavaScriptLearning level: IntermediateRequires: A decent level of JavaScript experience\n\n\n\nThe concept of design pattern refers to a reusable solution to a commonly recurring problem in application development. In this book, Addy Osmani covers the implementation of common design patterns using ES6 and beyond, as well as React-specific design patterns, which can be super handy when working on complex React apps where maintainability is a primary goal.\n\n\n\nSome of the patterns covered include Singleton, Proxy, Provider, Prototype and Observer patterns. In some cases, Addy includes pros and cons of using some of these patterns and how they may affect the performance of your application.\n\n\n\n\nDirect Link\n\n\n\nYou Don’t Know JS by Kyle Simpson\n\n\nPerfect for: Mastering JavaScriptLearning level: BeginnerRequires: Little or no prior programming experience\n\n\n\nWhile the title might be a bit provocative, what Kyle is implying here is that he writes this book assuming you have no prior JavaScript experience whatsoever.\n\n\n\nKyle begins starts by going through the rudiments of programming as seen through the lens of JavaScript. He then proceeds, in subsequent chapters, to introduce more advanced concepts like scope and closure, the this keyword, object prototypes, async, and performance.\n\n\n\nThere’s a lot of excellent details and explanations in here, and Kyle makes it super easy to understand by avoiding super technical jargon. There is also many exercises designed to reinforce your learning. This book will definitely get you up to speed with JavaScript. There’s second edition of the book in the works that you can track in GitHub.\n\n\n\n\nDirect link\n\n\n\nThe JavaScript Beginner’s Handbook by Flavio Copes\n\n\nPerfect for: A beginner’s referenceLearning level: Just getting startedRequires: Email sign-up, maybe some prior experience\n\n\n\nFlavio has put together a very useful JavaScript reference for those just starting out. It’s more like a quick reference guide than a textbook, so those of you just starting out might want to consider this as something you keep on your desk rather than something you sit with for long periods of time.\n\n\n\n\nDirect link\n\n\n\nJavaScript for Data Science by Gans, Hodges & Wilson\n\n\nPerfect for: Getting into data visualizationsLearning level: Intermediate to advancedRequires: A decent handle on JavaScript\n\n\n\nThe authors cover core features of modern JavScript, including callbacks, promises, inheritance, objects and classes. They also get into testing using Mocha, React, and data vizualization, all of which are great for anyone looking to level up their code and how its written. The book doesn’t get as deep into many the concepts as some of the other books, but it really shines when it gets into data science.\n\n\n\nThe book uses Data-Forge; a JavaScript library designed for working with tabular data. There are numerous exercises to help readers keep up to speed with the subject of discussion. The last chapter also includes a capstone project that pulls everything together.\n\n\n\n\nDirect Link\n\n\n\nWrapping up\n\n\nI sure hope this collection of books help you, whether you’re taking your first steps in front-end web development, have a dozen years under your belt, or you fall somewhere in between. I know how hard it is to get into something new for the first time and the feeling of not knowing where to look. I also know how it feels to hit a plateau and need something to level me up. There should be something for everyone here, regardless of where you are in your learning journey.\n\n\n\nAnd, hey, if you have any other books that are available to snag for free online, please share them in the comments! I bet we can get an even bigger list going.\n\nGreat (and Free!) Web Development Books You Can Get Online originally published on CSS-Tricks. You should get the newsletter.",

But all of them rely on the same code structure and we only update a few values to create variations. That’s all the power of CSS.

Between 0% and 100%, the animation changes the <code>background-size</code> of the element’s background gradient. Each keyframe sets three background sizes (one for each gradient).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"911\" height=\"176\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/s_98F21CD3C1C7899779F98C6C3E6075E37A8E660CF4703968B4D3A7A973FF0FA6_1651524284295_image.png?resize=911%2C176&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-366528\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/s_98F21CD3C1C7899779F98C6C3E6075E37A8E660CF4703968B4D3A7A973FF0FA6_1651524284295_image.png?w=911&amp;ssl=1 911w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/s_98F21CD3C1C7899779F98C6C3E6075E37A8E660CF4703968B4D3A7A973FF0FA6_1651524284295_image.png?resize=300%2C58&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/s_98F21CD3C1C7899779F98C6C3E6075E37A8E660CF4703968B4D3A7A973FF0FA6_1651524284295_image.png?resize=768%2C148&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And here’s what we get:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_ZErYBPd\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/ZErYBPd?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=ZErYBPd&amp;default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed ZErYBPd\" title=\"CodePen Embed ZErYBPd\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Can you start to imagine all the possible variations we can get by playing with different animation configurations for the sizes or the positions?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s fix the size to <code>20% 50%</code> and update the positions this time:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.loader {\n  width: 45px;\n  aspect-ratio: .75;\n  --c: no-repeat linear-gradient(#000 0 0);\n  background: \n    var(--c),\n    var(--c),\n    var(--c);\n  background-size: 20% 50%;\n  animation: load 1s infinite linear;\n}\n@keyframes load {\n  0%   { background-position: 0% 100%, 50% 100%, 100% 100%; } /* 1 */\n  20%  { background-position: 0% 50% , 50% 100%, 100% 100%; } /* 2 */\n  40%  { background-position: 0% 0%  , 50% 50% , 100% 100%; } /* 3 */\n  60%  { background-position: 0% 100%, 50% 0%  , 100% 50%;  } /* 4 */\n  80%  { background-position: 0% 100%, 50% 100%, 100% 0%;   } /* 5 */ \n  100% { background-position: 0% 100%, 50% 100%, 100% 100%; } /* 6 */\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"923\" height=\"215\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/s_98F21CD3C1C7899779F98C6C3E6075E37A8E660CF4703968B4D3A7A973FF0FA6_1651525274479_image.png?resize=923%2C215&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-366529\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/s_98F21CD3C1C7899779F98C6C3E6075E37A8E660CF4703968B4D3A7A973FF0FA6_1651525274479_image.png?w=923&amp;ssl=1 923w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/s_98F21CD3C1C7899779F98C6C3E6075E37A8E660CF4703968B4D3A7A973FF0FA6_1651525274479_image.png?resize=300%2C70&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/s_98F21CD3C1C7899779F98C6C3E6075E37A8E660CF4703968B4D3A7A973FF0FA6_1651525274479_image.png?resize=768%2C179&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>…which gets us another loader!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_gOvbgpe\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/gOvbgpe?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=gOvbgpe&amp;default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed gOvbgpe\" title=\"CodePen Embed gOvbgpe\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ve probably got the trick by now.

To simulate a continuous gradient, we need to play with <code>background</code> properties. In the above figure, the green area defines the area covered by the loader. That area should be the size of the gradient and, if we do the math, it’s equal to multiplying both sides labeled <code>S</code> in the diagram, or <code>background-size: var(--s) var(--s)</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since our elements are individually placed, we need to update the position of the gradient inside each one to make sure all of them overlap. This way, we’re simulating one continuous gradient even though it’s really three of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the main element (placed at the center), the background needs to be at the center. We use the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.loader {\n  /* etc. */\n  background: linear-gradient() 50% / var(--s) var(--s);\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>For the pseudo-element on the left, we need the background on the left</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.loader::before {\n  /* etc. */\n  background: linear-gradient() 0% / var(--s) var(--s);\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>And for the pseudo on the right, the background needs to be positioned to the right:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.loader::after {\n  background: linear-gradient() 100% / var(--s) var(--s);\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Using the same CSS variable, <code>--_i</code>, that we used for the translate, we can write the code like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"3,20\"><code markup=\"tt\">.loader {\n  --s: 100px; /* control the size */\n  --c: linear-gradient(/* etc. */); /* control the coloration */\n\n  display: grid;\n  place-items: center;\n  place-content: center;\n}\n.loader::before,\n.loader::after{\n  content: \"\";\n  grid-area: 1/1;\n}\n.loader,\n.loader::before,\n.loader::after{\n  height: var(--s);\n  width: calc(var(--s) / 5);\n  border-radius: var(--s);\n  background: var(--c) calc(50% + var(--_i, 0) * 50%) / var(--s) var(--s);\n  transform: translate(calc(var(--_i, 0) * 200%));\n}\n.loader::before { --_i: -1; }\n.loader::after  { --_i:  1; }</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, all we have to do is to animate the height and add some delays! Here are three examples where all that’s different are the colors and sizes:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_qBxEzeV/bdae7decca2724c24e7dc97c534d7847\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/qBxEzeV/bdae7decca2724c24e7dc97c534d7847?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=qBxEzeV/bdae7decca2724c24e7dc97c534d7847&amp;default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed qBxEzeV/bdae7decca2724c24e7dc97c534d7847\" title=\"CodePen Embed qBxEzeV/bdae7decca2724c24e7dc97c534d7847\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"wrapping-up\">Wrapping up</h3>\n\n\n<p>I hope so far you are feeling super encouraged by all the powers you have to make complex-looking loading animations.

      "content_text": "We’ve looked at spinners. We’ve looked at dots. Now we’re going to tackle another common pattern for loaders: bars. And we’re going to do the same thing in this third article of the series as we have the others by making it with only one element and with flexible CSS that makes it easy to create variations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle series\n\n\nSingle Element Loaders: The SpinnerSingle Element Loaders: The DotsSingle Element Loaders: The Bars — you are hereSingle Element Loaders: Going 3D\n\n\n\n\nLet’s start with not one, not two, but 20 examples of bar loaders.\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nWhat?! Are you going to detail each one of them? That’s too much for an article!\n\n\n\nIt might seem like that at first glance! But all of them rely on the same code structure and we only update a few values to create variations. That’s all the power of CSS. We don’t learn how to create one loader, but we learn different techniques that allow us to create as much loader as we want using merely the same code structure.\n\n\nLet’s make some bars!\n\n\nWe start by defining the dimensions for them using width (or height) with aspect-ratio to maintain proportion:\n\n\n\n.bars {\n  width: 45px;\n  aspect-ratio: 1;\n}\n\n\n\nWe sort of “fake” three bars with a linear gradient on the background — very similar to how we created dot loaders in Part 2 of this series.\n\n\n\n.bars {\n  width: 45px;\n  aspect-ratio: 1;\n  --c: no-repeat linear-gradient(#000 0 0); /* we define the color here */\n  background: \n    var(--c) 0%   50%,\n    var(--c) 50%  50%,\n    var(--c) 100% 50%;\n  background-size: 20% 100%; /* 20% * (3 bars + 2 spaces) = 100% */\n}\n\n\n\nThe above code will give us the following result:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike the other articles in this series, we are going to deal with a lot of background trickery. So, if you ever feel like we’re jumping around too fast or feel you need a little more detail, please do check those out. You can also read my Stack Overflow answer where I give a detailed explanation on how all this works.\n\n\nAnimating the bars\n\n\nWe either animate the element’s size or position to create the bar loader. Let’s animate the size by defining the following animation keyframes:\n\n\n\n@keyframes load {\n  0%   { background-size: 20% 100%, 20% 100%, 20% 100%; }  /* 1 */\n  33%  { background-size: 20% 10% , 20% 100%, 20% 100%; }  /* 2 */\n  50%  { background-size: 20% 100%, 20% 10% , 20% 100%; }  /* 3 */\n  66%  { background-size: 20% 100%, 20% 100%, 20% 10%;  }  /* 4 */\n  100% { background-size: 20% 100%, 20% 100%, 20% 100%; }  /* 5 */\n}\n\n\n\nSee what’s happening there? Between 0% and 100%, the animation changes the background-size of the element’s background gradient. Each keyframe sets three background sizes (one for each gradient).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd here’s what we get:\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nCan you start to imagine all the possible variations we can get by playing with different animation configurations for the sizes or the positions?\n\n\n\nLet’s fix the size to 20% 50% and update the positions this time:\n\n\n\n.loader {\n  width: 45px;\n  aspect-ratio: .75;\n  --c: no-repeat linear-gradient(#000 0 0);\n  background: \n    var(--c),\n    var(--c),\n    var(--c);\n  background-size: 20% 50%;\n  animation: load 1s infinite linear;\n}\n@keyframes load {\n  0%   { background-position: 0% 100%, 50% 100%, 100% 100%; } /* 1 */\n  20%  { background-position: 0% 50% , 50% 100%, 100% 100%; } /* 2 */\n  40%  { background-position: 0% 0%  , 50% 50% , 100% 100%; } /* 3 */\n  60%  { background-position: 0% 100%, 50% 0%  , 100% 50%;  } /* 4 */\n  80%  { background-position: 0% 100%, 50% 100%, 100% 0%;   } /* 5 */ \n  100% { background-position: 0% 100%, 50% 100%, 100% 100%; } /* 6 */\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n…which gets us another loader!\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nYou’ve probably got the trick by now. All you need is to define a timeline that you translate into a keyframe. By animating the size, the position — or both! — there’s an infinite number of loader possibilities at our fingertips.\n\n\n\nAnd once we get comfortable with such a technique we can go further and use a more complex gradient to create even more loaders.\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nExpect for the last two examples in that demo, all of the bar loaders use the same underlying markup and styles and different combinations of animations.

We can do the same here!\n\n\n\nIf we apply all the above logic inside the mask property we can use any background configuration to add a fancy coloration to our loaders.\n\n\n\nLet’s take one demo and update it:\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nAll I did is updating all the background-* with mask-* and I added a gradient coloration. As simple as that and yet we get another cool loader.\n\n\n\nSo there is no difference between the dots and the bars?\n\n\n\nNo difference! I wrote two different articles to cover as many examples as possible but in both, I am relying on the same techniques:\n\n\n\nGradients to create the shapes (dots or bars or maybe something else)Animating background-size and/or background-position to create the loader animationAdding mask to add a touch of colors\n\n\nRounding the bars\n\n\nLet’s try something different this time where we can round the edges of our bars.\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nUsing one element and its ::before and ::after pseudos, we define three identical bars:\n\n\n\n.loader {\n  --s: 100px; /* control the size */\n\n  display: grid;\n  place-items: center;\n  place-content: center;\n  margin: 0 calc(var(--s) / 2); /* 50px */\n}\n.loader::before,\n.loader::after {\n  content: \"\";\n  grid-area: 1/1;\n}\n.loader,\n.loader::before,\n.loader::after {\n  height: var(--s);\n  width: calc(var(--s) / 5); /* 20px */\n  border-radius: var(--s);\n  transform: translate(calc(var(--_i, 0) * 200%));\n}\n.loader::before { --_i: -1; }\n.loader::after { --_i:  1; }\n\n\n\nThat gives us three bars, this time without relying on a linear gradient:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the trick is to fill in those bars with a lovely gradient. To simulate a continuous gradient, we need to play with background properties. In the above figure, the green area defines the area covered by the loader. That area should be the size of the gradient and, if we do the math, it’s equal to multiplying both sides labeled S in the diagram, or background-size: var(--s) var(--s).\n\n\n\nSince our elements are individually placed, we need to update the position of the gradient inside each one to make sure all of them overlap. This way, we’re simulating one continuous gradient even though it’s really three of them.\n\n\n\nFor the main element (placed at the center), the background needs to be at the center. We use the following:\n\n\n\n.loader {\n  /* etc. */\n  background: linear-gradient() 50% / var(--s) var(--s);\n}\n\n\n\nFor the pseudo-element on the left, we need the background on the left\n\n\n\n.loader::before {\n  /* etc. */\n  background: linear-gradient() 0% / var(--s) var(--s);\n}\n\n\n\nAnd for the pseudo on the right, the background needs to be positioned to the right:\n\n\n\n.loader::after {\n  background: linear-gradient() 100% / var(--s) var(--s);\n}\n\n\n\nUsing the same CSS variable, --_i, that we used for the translate, we can write the code like this:\n\n\n\n.loader {\n  --s: 100px; /* control the size */\n  --c: linear-gradient(/* etc. */); /* control the coloration */\n\n  display: grid;\n  place-items: center;\n  place-content: center;\n}\n.loader::before,\n.loader::after{\n  content: \"\";\n  grid-area: 1/1;\n}\n.loader,\n.loader::before,\n.loader::after{\n  height: var(--s);\n  width: calc(var(--s) / 5);\n  border-radius: var(--s);\n  background: var(--c) calc(50% + var(--_i, 0) * 50%) / var(--s) var(--s);\n  transform: translate(calc(var(--_i, 0) * 200%));\n}\n.loader::before { --_i: -1; }\n.loader::after  { --_i:  1; }\n\n\n\nNow, all we have to do is to animate the height and add some delays! Here are three examples where all that’s different are the colors and sizes:\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\nWrapping up\n\n\nI hope so far you are feeling super encouraged by all the powers you have to make complex-looking loading animations. All we need is one element, either gradients or pseudos to draw the bars, then some keyframes to move things around. That’s the entire recipe for getting an endless number of possibilities, so go out and starting cooking up some neat stuff!\n\n\n\nUntil the next article, I will leave you with a funny collection of loaders where I am combining the dots and the bars!\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nArticle series\n\n\nSingle Element Loaders: The SpinnerSingle Element Loaders: The DotsSingle Element Loaders: The Bars — you are hereSingle Element Loaders: Going 3D\n\n\nSingle Element Loaders: The Bars originally published on CSS-Tricks.

And when we’re done, we’ll see how animating a background gradient helps create the illusion of each dot changing colors as they move up and down in succession.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The background animation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s start with the background animation:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.loader {\n  width: 180px; /* this controls the size */\n  aspect-ratio: 8/5; /* maintain the scale */\n  background: \n    conic-gradient(red   50%, blue   0) no-repeat, /* top colors */\n    conic-gradient(green 50%, purple 0) no-repeat; /* bottom colors */\n  background-size: 200% 50%; \n  animation: back 4s infinite linear; /* applies the animation */\n}\n\n/* define the animation */\n@keyframes back {\n  0%,                       /* X   Y , X     Y */\n  100% { background-position: 0%   0%, 0%   100%; }\n  25%  { background-position: 100% 0%, 0%   100%; }\n  50%  { background-position: 100% 0%, 100% 100%; }\n  75%  { background-position: 0%   0%, 100% 100%; }\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope this looks pretty straightforward. What we’ve got is a <code>180px</code>-wide <code>.loader</code> element that shows two conic gradients sporting hard color stops between two colors each — the first gradient is red and blue along the top half of the <code>.loader</code>, and the second gradient is green and purple along the bottom half.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The way the loader’s background is sized (<code>200%</code> wide), we only see one of those colors in each half at a time. Then we have this little animation that pushes the position of those background gradients left, right, and back again forever and ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When dealing with background properties — especially <code>background-position</code> — I always refer to my <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/51734530/8620333\" rel=\"noopener\">Stack Overflow answer where I am giving a detailed explanation</a> on how all this works. If you are uncomfortable with CSS background trickery, I highly recommend reading that answer to help with what comes next.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the animation, notice that the first layer is <code>Y=0%</code> (placed at the top) while <code>X</code> is changes from <code>0%</code> to <code>100%.</code> For the second layer, we have the same for <code>X</code> but <code>Y=100%</code> (placed at the bottom).</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_gOvOjZy\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/gOvOjZy?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=gOvOjZy&amp;default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed gOvOjZy\" title=\"CodePen Embed gOvOjZy\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Why using a <code>conic-gradient()</code> instead of <code>linear-gradient()</code>?</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Good question!

So, in this case, we want to make a few dots, show the background gradients through the dots, and cut out any parts of the background that are not part of a dot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are going to use <code>radial-gradient()</code> for this:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"4,5,6,7,8,9\"><code markup=\"tt\">.loader {\n  width: 180px;\n  aspect-ratio: 8/5;\n  mask:\n    radial-gradient(#000 68%, #0000 71%) no-repeat,\n    radial-gradient(#000 68%, #0000 71%) no-repeat,\n    radial-gradient(#000 68%, #0000 71%) no-repeat;\n  mask-size: 25% 40%; /* the size of our dots */\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s some duplicated code in there, so let&#8217;s make a CSS variable to slim things down:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"4\"><code markup=\"tt\">.loader {\n  width: 180px;\n  aspect-ratio: 8/5;\n  --_g: radial-gradient(#000 68%, #0000 71%) no-repeat;\n  mask: var(--_g),var(--_g),var(--_g);\n  mask-size: 25% 40%;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Cool cool. But now we need a new animation that helps move the dots up and down between the animated gradients.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.loader {\n  /* same as before */\n  animation: load 2s infinite;\n}\n\n@keyframes load {      /* X  Y,     X   Y,    X   Y */\n  0%     { mask-position: 0% 0%  , 50% 0%  , 100% 0%; } /* all of them at the top */\n  16.67% { mask-position: 0% 100%, 50% 0%  , 100% 0%; }\n  33.33% { mask-position: 0% 100%, 50% 100%, 100% 0%; }\n  50%    { mask-position: 0% 100%, 50% 100%, 100% 100%; } /* all of them at the bottom */\n  66.67% { mask-position: 0% 0%  , 50% 100%, 100% 100%; }\n  83.33% { mask-position: 0% 0%  , 50% 0%  , 100% 100%; }\n  100%   { mask-position: 0% 0%  , 50% 0%  , 100% 0%; } /* all of them at the top */\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, that’s a total of three radial gradients in there, all with the same configuration and the same size — the animation will update the position of each one. Note that the <code>X</code> coordinate of each dot is fixed. The <code>mask-position</code> is defined such that the first dot is at the left (<code>0%</code>), the second one at the center (<code>50%</code>), and the third one at the right (<code>100%</code>). We only update the <code>Y</code> coordinate from <code>0%</code> to <code>100%</code> to make the dots dance.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"523\" height=\"362\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/s_98F21CD3C1C7899779F98C6C3E6075E37A8E660CF4703968B4D3A7A973FF0FA6_1651441844341_image.png?resize=523%2C362&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Dot loader dots with labels showing their changing positions.\" class=\"wp-image-366345\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/s_98F21CD3C1C7899779F98C6C3E6075E37A8E660CF4703968B4D3A7A973FF0FA6_1651441844341_image.png?w=523&amp;ssl=1 523w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/s_98F21CD3C1C7899779F98C6C3E6075E37A8E660CF4703968B4D3A7A973FF0FA6_1651441844341_image.png?resize=300%2C208&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what we get:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_abqbamK\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/abqbamK?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=abqbamK&amp;default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed abqbamK\" title=\"CodePen Embed abqbamK\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, combine this with our gradient animation and magic starts to happen:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_vYdYzxq\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/vYdYzxq?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=vYdYzxq&amp;default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed vYdYzxq\" title=\"CodePen Embed vYdYzxq\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Dot loader variations</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The CSS variable we made in the last example makes it all that much easier to swap in new colors and create more variations of the same loader.

The main element and its two pseudo-elements have the same background configuration with one radial gradient. Each one creates one dot, for a total of three. The animation moves the gradient from top to bottom by using different delays for each dot..</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, and take note how this demo uses CSS Grid. This allows us to leverage the grid’s default <code>stretch</code> alignment so that both pseudo-elements cover the whole area of their parent. No need for sizing! Push the around a little with <code>translate()</code> and we’re all set.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>More examples!</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Just to drive the point home, I want to leave you with a bunch of additional examples that are really variations of what we’ve looked at.

      "content_text": "We’re looking at loaders in this series. More than that, we’re breaking down some common loader patterns and how to re-create them with nothing more than a single div. So far, we’ve picked apart the classic spinning loader. Now, let’s look at another one you’re likely well aware of: the dots.\n\n\n\nDot loaders are all over the place. They’re neat because they usually consist of three dots that sort of look like a text ellipsis (…) that dances around.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle series\n\n\n\nSingle Element Loaders: The SpinnerSingle Element Loaders: The Dots — you are hereSingle Element Loaders: The BarsSingle Element Loaders: Going 3D\n\n\n\n\nOur goal here is to make this same thing out of a single div element. In other words, there is no one div per dot or individual animations for each dot.\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nThat example of a loader up above is made with a single div element, a few CSS declarations, and no pseudo-elements. I am combining two techniques using CSS background and mask. And when we’re done, we’ll see how animating a background gradient helps create the illusion of each dot changing colors as they move up and down in succession.\n\n\n\nThe background animation\n\n\n\nLet’s start with the background animation:\n\n\n\n.loader {\n  width: 180px; /* this controls the size */\n  aspect-ratio: 8/5; /* maintain the scale */\n  background: \n    conic-gradient(red   50%, blue   0) no-repeat, /* top colors */\n    conic-gradient(green 50%, purple 0) no-repeat; /* bottom colors */\n  background-size: 200% 50%; \n  animation: back 4s infinite linear; /* applies the animation */\n}\n\n/* define the animation */\n@keyframes back {\n  0%,                       /* X   Y , X     Y */\n  100% { background-position: 0%   0%, 0%   100%; }\n  25%  { background-position: 100% 0%, 0%   100%; }\n  50%  { background-position: 100% 0%, 100% 100%; }\n  75%  { background-position: 0%   0%, 100% 100%; }\n}\n\n\n\nI hope this looks pretty straightforward. What we’ve got is a 180px-wide .loader element that shows two conic gradients sporting hard color stops between two colors each — the first gradient is red and blue along the top half of the .loader, and the second gradient is green and purple along the bottom half.\n\n\n\nThe way the loader’s background is sized (200% wide), we only see one of those colors in each half at a time. Then we have this little animation that pushes the position of those background gradients left, right, and back again forever and ever.\n\n\n\nWhen dealing with background properties — especially background-position — I always refer to my Stack Overflow answer where I am giving a detailed explanation on how all this works. If you are uncomfortable with CSS background trickery, I highly recommend reading that answer to help with what comes next.\n\n\n\nIn the animation, notice that the first layer is Y=0% (placed at the top) while X is changes from 0% to 100%. For the second layer, we have the same for X but Y=100% (placed at the bottom).\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nWhy using a conic-gradient() instead of linear-gradient()?\n\n\n\nGood question! Intuitively, we should use a linear gradient to create a two-color gradients like this:\n\n\n\nlinear-gradient(90deg, red 50%, blue 0)\n\n\n\nBut we can also reach for the same using a conic-gradient() — and with less of code. We reduce the code and also learn a new trick in the process!\n\n\n\nSliding the colors left and right is a nice way to make it look like we’re changing colors, but it might be better if we instantly change colors instead — that way, there’s no chance of a loader dot flashing two colors at the same time. To do this, let’s change the animation‘s timing function from linear to steps(1)\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nThe loader dots\n\n\n\nIf you followed along with the first article in this series, I bet you know what comes next: CSS masks! What makes masks so great is that they let us sort of “cut out” parts of a background in the shape of another element. So, in this case, we want to make a few dots, show the background gradients through the dots, and cut out any parts of the background that are not part of a dot.\n\n\n\nWe are going to use radial-gradient() for this:\n\n\n\n.loader {\n  width: 180px;\n  aspect-ratio: 8/5;\n  mask:\n    radial-gradient(#000 68%, #0000 71%) no-repeat,\n    radial-gradient(#000 68%, #0000 71%) no-repeat,\n    radial-gradient(#000 68%, #0000 71%) no-repeat;\n  mask-size: 25% 40%; /* the size of our dots */\n}\n\n\n\nThere’s some duplicated code in there, so let’s make a CSS variable to slim things down:\n\n\n\n.loader {\n  width: 180px;\n  aspect-ratio: 8/5;\n  --_g: radial-gradient(#000 68%, #0000 71%) no-repeat;\n  mask: var(--_g),var(--_g),var(--_g);\n  mask-size: 25% 40%;\n}\n\n\n\nCool cool. But now we need a new animation that helps move the dots up and down between the animated gradients.\n\n\n\n.loader {\n  /* same as before */\n  animation: load 2s infinite;\n}\n\n@keyframes load {      /* X  Y,     X   Y,    X   Y */\n  0%     { mask-position: 0% 0%  , 50% 0%  , 100% 0%; } /* all of them at the top */\n  16.67% { mask-position: 0% 100%, 50% 0%  , 100% 0%; }\n  33.33% { mask-position: 0% 100%, 50% 100%, 100% 0%; }\n  50%    { mask-position: 0% 100%, 50% 100%, 100% 100%; } /* all of them at the bottom */\n  66.67% { mask-position: 0% 0%  , 50% 100%, 100% 100%; }\n  83.33% { mask-position: 0% 0%  , 50% 0%  , 100% 100%; }\n  100%   { mask-position: 0% 0%  , 50% 0%  , 100% 0%; } /* all of them at the top */\n}\n\n\n\nYes, that’s a total of three radial gradients in there, all with the same configuration and the same size — the animation will update the position of each one. Note that the X coordinate of each dot is fixed. The mask-position is defined such that the first dot is at the left (0%), the second one at the center (50%), and the third one at the right (100%). We only update the Y coordinate from 0% to 100% to make the dots dance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s what we get:\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nNow, combine this with our gradient animation and magic starts to happen:\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nDot loader variations\n\n\n\nThe CSS variable we made in the last example makes it all that much easier to swap in new colors and create more variations of the same loader. For example, different colors and sizes:\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nWhat about another movement for our dots?\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nHere, all I did was update the animation to consider different positions, and we get another loader with the same code structure!\n\n\n\nThe animation technique I used for the mask layers can also be used with background layers to create a lot of different loaders with a single color. I wrote a detailed article about this. You will see that from the same code structure we can create different variations by simply changing a few values. I am sharing a few examples at the end of the article.\n\n\n\nWhy not a loader with one dot?\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nThis one should be fairly easy to grok as I am using the same technique but with a more simple logic:\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nHere is another example of loader where I am also animating radial-gradient combined with CSS filters and mix-blend-mode to create a blobby effect:\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nIf you check the code, you will see that all I am really doing there is animating the background-position, exactly like we did with the previous loader, but adding a dash of background-size to make it look like the blob gets bigger as it absorbs dots.\n\n\n\nIf you want to understand the magic behind that blob effect, you can refer to these interactive slides (Chrome only) by Ana Tudor because she covers the topic so well!\n\n\n\nHere is another dot loader idea, this time using a different technique:\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nThis one is only 10 CSS declarations and a keyframe. The main element and its two pseudo-elements have the same background configuration with one radial gradient. Each one creates one dot, for a total of three. The animation moves the gradient from top to bottom by using different delays for each dot..\n\n\n\nOh, and take note how this demo uses CSS Grid. This allows us to leverage the grid’s default stretch alignment so that both pseudo-elements cover the whole area of their parent. No need for sizing! Push the around a little with translate() and we’re all set.\n\n\n\nMore examples!\n\n\n\nJust to drive the point home, I want to leave you with a bunch of additional examples that are really variations of what we’ve looked at. As you view the demos, you’ll see that the approaches we’ve covered here are super flexible and open up tons of design possibilities.\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nNext up…\n\n\n\nOK, so we covered dot loaders in this article and spinners in the last one. In the next article of this four-part series, we’ll turn our attention to another common type of loader: the bars. We’ll take a lot of what we learned so far and see how we can extend them to create yet another single element loader with as little code and as much flexibility as possible.\n\n\n\n\nArticle series\n\n\n\nSingle Element Loaders: The SpinnerSingle Element Loaders: The Dots — you are hereSingle Element Loaders: The BarsSingle Element Loaders: Going 3D\n\n\nSingle Element Loaders: The Dots originally published on CSS-Tricks.

No, not recreating that reCAPTCHA, but simply being able to select multiple items. And when two or more adjoining items are selected, we can use clever <code>:nth-of-type</code> combinators, pseudo elements, and the <code>:checked</code> pseudo-class to style them in a way where they look grouped together.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_VwQzWqP\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/VwQzWqP?height=550&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=VwQzWqP&amp;default-tab=result\" height=\"550\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed VwQzWqP\" title=\"CodePen Embed VwQzWqP\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The whole idea of combinators and pseudos to get the rounded checkboxes came from a <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/fun-times-styling-checkbox-states/\">previous article I wrote</a>. It was a simple single-column design:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_mdwbXga\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/mdwbXga?height=550&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=mdwbXga&amp;default-tab=result\" height=\"550\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed mdwbXga\" title=\"CodePen Embed mdwbXga\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\n\n\n\n<p>This time, however, the rounding effect is applied to elements along both the vertical and horizontal axes on a grid. You don’t have to have read my last article on checkbox styling for this since I’m going to cover everything you need to know here. But if you’re interested in a slimmed down take on what we’re doing in this article, then that one is worth checking out.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Before we start…</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It’ll be useful for you to take note of a few things. For example, I’m using static HTML and CSS in my demo for the sake of simplicity. Depending on your application you might have to generate the grid and the items in it dynamically. I’m leaving out practical checks for accessibility in order to focus on the effect, but you would definitely want to consider that sort of thing in a production environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, I’m using CSS Grid for the layout. I’d recommend the same but, of course, it’s only a personal preference and your mileage may vary. For me, using grid allows me to easily use sibling-selectors to target an item’s <code>::before</code> and <code>::after</code> pseudos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hence, whatever layout standard you might want to use in your application, make sure the pseudos can still be targeted in CSS and ensure the layout stays in tact across different browsers and screens.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Let’s get started now</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As you may have noticed in the earlier demo, checking and unchecking a checkbox element modifies the design of the boxes, depending on the selection state of the other checkboxes around it. This is possible because I styled each box using the pseudo-elements of its adjacent elements instead of its own element.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following figure shows how the <code>::before</code> pseudo-elements of boxes in each <em>column</em> (except the first column) overlap the boxes to their left, and how the <code>::after</code> pseudo-elements of boxes in each <em>row</em> (except the first row) overlap the boxes above.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1360\" height=\"994\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/s_C6C1FBE60A3624B876B34697BF3BE9266CAA9E9CFB20B11CDBDE5D32FDF0FD18_1654436553993_diagram.png?resize=1360%2C994&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Two grids of checkboxes showing the placement of before and after pseudos.\" class=\"wp-image-366254\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/s_C6C1FBE60A3624B876B34697BF3BE9266CAA9E9CFB20B11CDBDE5D32FDF0FD18_1654436553993_diagram.png?w=1360&amp;ssl=1 1360w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/s_C6C1FBE60A3624B876B34697BF3BE9266CAA9E9CFB20B11CDBDE5D32FDF0FD18_1654436553993_diagram.png?resize=300%2C219&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/s_C6C1FBE60A3624B876B34697BF3BE9266CAA9E9CFB20B11CDBDE5D32FDF0FD18_1654436553993_diagram.png?resize=1024%2C748&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/s_C6C1FBE60A3624B876B34697BF3BE9266CAA9E9CFB20B11CDBDE5D32FDF0FD18_1654436553993_diagram.png?resize=768%2C561&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Here’s the base code</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The markup is pretty straightforward:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"HTML\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">&lt;main>\n  &lt;input type=checkbox> \n  &lt;input type=checkbox> \n  &lt;input type=checkbox>\n  &lt;!-- more boxes -->\n&lt;/main></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a little more going on in the initial CSS. But, first, the grid itself:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">/* The grid */\nmain {\n  display: grid;\n  grid:  repeat(5, 60px) / repeat(4, 85px);\n  align-items: center;\n  justify-items: center;\n  margin: 0;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s a grid of five rows and four columns that contain checkboxes. I decided to wipe out the default appearance of the checkboxes, then give them my own light gray background and super rounded borders:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">/* all checkboxes */\ninput {\n  -webkit-appearance: none;\n  appearance: none;\n  background: #ddd;\n  border-radius: 20px;\n  cursor: pointer;\n  display: grid;\n  height: 40px;\n  width: 60px;\n  margin: 0;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Notice, too, that the checkboxes themselves are grids. That’s key for placing their <code>::before</code> and <code>::after</code> pseudo-elements. Speaking of which, let’s do that now:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">/* pseudo-elements except for the first column and first row */\ninput:not(:nth-of-type(4n+1))::before,\ninput:nth-of-type(n+5)::after {\n  content: '';        \n  border-radius: 20px;\n  grid-area: 1 / 1;\n  pointer-events: none;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re only selecting the pseudo-elements of checkboxes that are not in the first column or the first row of the grid. <code>input:not(:nth-of-type(4n+1))</code> starts at the first checkbox, then selects the <code>::before</code> of every fourth item from there. But notice we’re saying <code>:not()</code>, so really what we’re doing is <em>skipping</em> the <code>::before</code> pseudo-element of every fourth checkbox, starting at the first. Then we’re applying styles to the <code>::after</code> pseudo of every checkbox from the fifth one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now we can style both the <code>::before</code> and <code>::after</code> pseudos for each checkbox that is not in the first column or row of the grid, so that they are moved left or up, respectively, hiding them by default.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">/* pseudo-elements other than the first column */\ninput:not(:nth-of-type(4n+1))::before { \n  transform: translatex(-85px);\n}\n\n/* pseudo-elements other than the first row */\ninput:nth-of-type(n+5)::after {\n transform: translatey(-60px); \n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h3>Styling the <code>:checked</code> state</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now comes styling the checkboxes when they are in a <code>:checked</code> state. First, let’s give them a color, say a <code>limegreen</code> background:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">input:checked { background: limegreen; }</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>A checked box should be able to re-style all of its adjacent checked boxes. In other words, if we select the eleventh checkbox in the grid, we should also be able to style the boxes surrounding it at the top, bottom, left, and right.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1242\" height=\"694\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/s_C6C1FBE60A3624B876B34697BF3BE9266CAA9E9CFB20B11CDBDE5D32FDF0FD18_1654511257743_grid.png?resize=1242%2C694&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"A four-by-five grid of squares numbered one through 20. 11 is selected and 7, 10, 12, and 15 are highlighted.\" class=\"wp-image-366255\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/s_C6C1FBE60A3624B876B34697BF3BE9266CAA9E9CFB20B11CDBDE5D32FDF0FD18_1654511257743_grid.png?w=1242&amp;ssl=1 1242w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/s_C6C1FBE60A3624B876B34697BF3BE9266CAA9E9CFB20B11CDBDE5D32FDF0FD18_1654511257743_grid.png?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/s_C6C1FBE60A3624B876B34697BF3BE9266CAA9E9CFB20B11CDBDE5D32FDF0FD18_1654511257743_grid.png?resize=1024%2C572&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/s_C6C1FBE60A3624B876B34697BF3BE9266CAA9E9CFB20B11CDBDE5D32FDF0FD18_1654511257743_grid.png?resize=768%2C429&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This is done by targeting the correct pseudo-elements. How do we do that? Well, it depends on the actual number of columns in the grid. Here’s the CSS if two adjacent boxes are checked in a 5⨉4 grid:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">/* a checked box's right borders (if the element to its right is checked) */\ninput:not(:nth-of-type(4n)):checked + input:checked::before { \n  border-top-right-radius: 0; \n  border-bottom-right-radius: 0; \n  background: limegreen;\n}\n/* a checked box's bottom borders (if the element below is checked) */\ninput:nth-last-of-type(n+5):checked + * + * + * + input:checked::after {\n  border-bottom-right-radius: 0;\n  border-bottom-left-radius: 0;\n  background: limegreen;\n}\n/* a checked box's adjacent (right side) checked box's left borders */\ninput:not(:nth-of-type(4n)):checked + input:checked + input::before {         \n  border-top-left-radius: 0; \n  border-bottom-left-radius: 0; \n  background: limegreen;\n}\n/* a checked box's adjacent (below) checked box's top borders */\ninput:not(:nth-of-type(4n)):checked + * + * + * +  input:checked + input::before { \n  border-top-left-radius: 0; \n  border-top-right-radius: 0; \n  background: limegreen;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>If you prefer you can generate the above code dynamically. However, a typical grid, say an image gallery, the number of columns will be small and likely a fixed number of items, whereas the rows might keep increasing. Especially if designed for mobile screens. That’s why this approach is still an efficient way to go. If for some reason your application happens to have limited rows and expanding columns, then consider rotating the grid sideways because, with a stream of items, CSS Grid arranges them left-to-right and top-to-bottom (i.e. row by row).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also need to add styling for the last checkboxes in the grid — they’re not all covered by pseudo-elements as they are the last items in each axis.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">/* a checked box's (in last column) left borders */\ninput:nth-of-type(4n-1):checked + input:checked {\n  border-top-left-radius: 0;\n  border-bottom-left-radius: 0;\n}\n/* a checked box's (in last column) adjacent (below) checked box's top borders */\ninput:nth-of-type(4n):checked + * + * + * + input:checked {\n  border-top-left-radius: 0;\n  border-top-right-radius: 0;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Those are some tricky selectors! The first one…</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">input:nth-of-type(4n-1):checked + input:checked</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>…is basically saying this:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>A checked <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element next to a checked <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> in the second last column.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And the <code>nth-of-type</code> is calculated like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-none\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">4(0) - 1 = no match\n4(1) - 1 = 3rd item\n4(2) - 1 = 7th item\n4(3) - 1 = 11th item\netc.</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>So, we’re starting at the third checkbox and selecting every fourth one from there. And if a checkbox in that sequence is checked, then we style the checkboxes adjacent, too, if they are also checked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this line:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">input:nth-of-type(4n):checked + * + * + * + input:checked</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Is saying this:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>An <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element provided that is checked, is directly adjacent to an element, which is directly adjacent to another element, which is also directly adjacent to another element, which, in turn, is directly adjacent to an <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element that is in a checked state.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>What that means is we’re selecting every fourth checkbox that is checked.

      "content_text": "Calendars, shopping carts, galleries, file explorers, and online libraries are some situations where selectable items are shown in grids (i.e. square lattices). You know, even those security checks that ask you to select all images with crosswalks or whatever.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🧐\n\n\n\nI found a neat way to display selectable options in a grid. No, not recreating that reCAPTCHA, but simply being able to select multiple items. And when two or more adjoining items are selected, we can use clever :nth-of-type combinators, pseudo elements, and the :checked pseudo-class to style them in a way where they look grouped together.\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nThe whole idea of combinators and pseudos to get the rounded checkboxes came from a previous article I wrote. It was a simple single-column design:\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nThis time, however, the rounding effect is applied to elements along both the vertical and horizontal axes on a grid. You don’t have to have read my last article on checkbox styling for this since I’m going to cover everything you need to know here. But if you’re interested in a slimmed down take on what we’re doing in this article, then that one is worth checking out.\n\n\n\nBefore we start…\n\n\n\nIt’ll be useful for you to take note of a few things. For example, I’m using static HTML and CSS in my demo for the sake of simplicity. Depending on your application you might have to generate the grid and the items in it dynamically. I’m leaving out practical checks for accessibility in order to focus on the effect, but you would definitely want to consider that sort of thing in a production environment.\n\n\n\nAlso, I’m using CSS Grid for the layout. I’d recommend the same but, of course, it’s only a personal preference and your mileage may vary. For me, using grid allows me to easily use sibling-selectors to target an item’s ::before and ::after pseudos.\n\n\n\nHence, whatever layout standard you might want to use in your application, make sure the pseudos can still be targeted in CSS and ensure the layout stays in tact across different browsers and screens.\n\n\n\nLet’s get started now\n\n\n\nAs you may have noticed in the earlier demo, checking and unchecking a checkbox element modifies the design of the boxes, depending on the selection state of the other checkboxes around it. This is possible because I styled each box using the pseudo-elements of its adjacent elements instead of its own element.\n\n\n\nThe following figure shows how the ::before pseudo-elements of boxes in each column (except the first column) overlap the boxes to their left, and how the ::after pseudo-elements of boxes in each row (except the first row) overlap the boxes above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s the base code\n\n\n\nThe markup is pretty straightforward:\n\n\n\n<main>\n  <input type=checkbox> \n  <input type=checkbox> \n  <input type=checkbox>\n  <!-- more boxes -->\n</main>\n\n\n\nThere’s a little more going on in the initial CSS. But, first, the grid itself:\n\n\n\n/* The grid */\nmain {\n  display: grid;\n  grid:  repeat(5, 60px) / repeat(4, 85px);\n  align-items: center;\n  justify-items: center;\n  margin: 0;\n}\n\n\n\nThat’s a grid of five rows and four columns that contain checkboxes. I decided to wipe out the default appearance of the checkboxes, then give them my own light gray background and super rounded borders:\n\n\n\n/* all checkboxes */\ninput {\n  -webkit-appearance: none;\n  appearance: none;\n  background: #ddd;\n  border-radius: 20px;\n  cursor: pointer;\n  display: grid;\n  height: 40px;\n  width: 60px;\n  margin: 0;\n}\n\n\n\nNotice, too, that the checkboxes themselves are grids. That’s key for placing their ::before and ::after pseudo-elements. Speaking of which, let’s do that now:\n\n\n\n/* pseudo-elements except for the first column and first row */\ninput:not(:nth-of-type(4n+1))::before,\ninput:nth-of-type(n+5)::after {\n  content: '';        \n  border-radius: 20px;\n  grid-area: 1 / 1;\n  pointer-events: none;\n}\n\n\n\nWe’re only selecting the pseudo-elements of checkboxes that are not in the first column or the first row of the grid. input:not(:nth-of-type(4n+1)) starts at the first checkbox, then selects the ::before of every fourth item from there. But notice we’re saying :not(), so really what we’re doing is skipping the ::before pseudo-element of every fourth checkbox, starting at the first. Then we’re applying styles to the ::after pseudo of every checkbox from the fifth one.\n\n\n\nNow we can style both the ::before and ::after pseudos for each checkbox that is not in the first column or row of the grid, so that they are moved left or up, respectively, hiding them by default.\n\n\n\n/* pseudo-elements other than the first column */\ninput:not(:nth-of-type(4n+1))::before { \n  transform: translatex(-85px);\n}\n\n/* pseudo-elements other than the first row */\ninput:nth-of-type(n+5)::after {\n transform: translatey(-60px); \n}\n\n\n\nStyling the :checked state\n\n\n\nNow comes styling the checkboxes when they are in a :checked state. First, let’s give them a color, say a limegreen background:\n\n\n\ninput:checked { background: limegreen; }\n\n\n\nA checked box should be able to re-style all of its adjacent checked boxes. In other words, if we select the eleventh checkbox in the grid, we should also be able to style the boxes surrounding it at the top, bottom, left, and right.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is done by targeting the correct pseudo-elements. How do we do that? Well, it depends on the actual number of columns in the grid. Here’s the CSS if two adjacent boxes are checked in a 5⨉4 grid:\n\n\n\n/* a checked box's right borders (if the element to its right is checked) */\ninput:not(:nth-of-type(4n)):checked + input:checked::before { \n  border-top-right-radius: 0; \n  border-bottom-right-radius: 0; \n  background: limegreen;\n}\n/* a checked box's bottom borders (if the element below is checked) */\ninput:nth-last-of-type(n+5):checked + * + * + * + input:checked::after {\n  border-bottom-right-radius: 0;\n  border-bottom-left-radius: 0;\n  background: limegreen;\n}\n/* a checked box's adjacent (right side) checked box's left borders */\ninput:not(:nth-of-type(4n)):checked + input:checked + input::before {         \n  border-top-left-radius: 0; \n  border-bottom-left-radius: 0; \n  background: limegreen;\n}\n/* a checked box's adjacent (below) checked box's top borders */\ninput:not(:nth-of-type(4n)):checked + * + * + * +  input:checked + input::before { \n  border-top-left-radius: 0; \n  border-top-right-radius: 0; \n  background: limegreen;\n}\n\n\n\nIf you prefer you can generate the above code dynamically. However, a typical grid, say an image gallery, the number of columns will be small and likely a fixed number of items, whereas the rows might keep increasing. Especially if designed for mobile screens. That’s why this approach is still an efficient way to go. If for some reason your application happens to have limited rows and expanding columns, then consider rotating the grid sideways because, with a stream of items, CSS Grid arranges them left-to-right and top-to-bottom (i.e. row by row).\n\n\n\nWe also need to add styling for the last checkboxes in the grid — they’re not all covered by pseudo-elements as they are the last items in each axis.\n\n\n\n/* a checked box's (in last column) left borders */\ninput:nth-of-type(4n-1):checked + input:checked {\n  border-top-left-radius: 0;\n  border-bottom-left-radius: 0;\n}\n/* a checked box's (in last column) adjacent (below) checked box's top borders */\ninput:nth-of-type(4n):checked + * + * + * + input:checked {\n  border-top-left-radius: 0;\n  border-top-right-radius: 0;\n}\n\n\n\nThose are some tricky selectors! The first one…\n\n\n\ninput:nth-of-type(4n-1):checked + input:checked\n\n\n\n…is basically saying this:\n\n\n\nA checked <input> element next to a checked <input> in the second last column.\n\n\n\nAnd the nth-of-type is calculated like this:\n\n\n\n4(0) - 1 = no match\n4(1) - 1 = 3rd item\n4(2) - 1 = 7th item\n4(3) - 1 = 11th item\netc.\n\n\n\nSo, we’re starting at the third checkbox and selecting every fourth one from there. And if a checkbox in that sequence is checked, then we style the checkboxes adjacent, too, if they are also checked.\n\n\n\nAnd this line:\n\n\n\ninput:nth-of-type(4n):checked + * + * + * + input:checked\n\n\n\nIs saying this:\n\n\n\nAn <input> element provided that is checked, is directly adjacent to an element, which is directly adjacent to another element, which is also directly adjacent to another element, which, in turn, is directly adjacent to an <input> element that is in a checked state.\n\n\n\nWhat that means is we’re selecting every fourth checkbox that is checked. And if a checkbox in that sequence is checked, then we style the next fourth checkbox from that checkbox if it, too, is checked.\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nPutting it to use\n\n\n\nWhat we just looked at is the general principle and logic behind the design. Again, how useful it is in your application will depend on the grid design.\n\n\n\nI used rounded borders, but you can try other shapes or even experiment with background effects (Temani has you covered for ideas). Now that you know how the formula works, the rest is totally up to your imagination.\n\n\n\nHere’s an instance of how it might look in a simple calendar:\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nAgain, this is merely a rough prototype using static markup. And, there would be lots and lots of accessibility considerations to consider in a calendar feature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s a wrap! Pretty neat, right?

      "content_html": "<p>Well, sheesh. I opened a little can of worms when sharing Miriam&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.miriamsuzanne.com/2022/06/04/indiweb/\" rel=\"noopener\">&#8220;Am I on the IndieWeb yet?&#8221;</a> with a <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/am-i-on-the-indieweb-yet/\">short post bemoaning my own trouble</a> getting on the IndieWeb train.

And gosh dang if it wasn&#8217;t ridiculously helpful! So much so that I&#8217;d like to <a href=\"https://david.shanske.com/2022/06/12/indiewebifying-a-wordpress-site-2022-edition/\" rel=\"noopener\">link you up to a new post David wrote after we talked</a>, then summarize things here as best as I can because (1) it&#8217;s helpful to write things down and (2) have a reference for later.</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-366388\"></span>\n\n\n\n<h3>Yes, IndieWeb is confusing.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>David had actually helped someone get their WordPress site all set up with IndieWeb powers. That person, too, was struggling to understand how the various pieces fit together. So, David already had this top of mind when Miriam and I were writing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;IndieWeb&#8221; is a new term for many folks and that&#8217;s where a lot of confusion breeds. Is it a framework? A philosophy? A set of standards? Depending on which one it is, the expectations shift as far as what it looks like to be a part of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s sort of all of the above. And that needs to be solidified a bit. There&#8217;s nothing inherently confusing about IndieWeb itself once you view it through those different lenses. After reading David&#8217;s post my understanding is that IndieWeb is more of a set of protocols. Sorta like working with structured data or OpenGraph in markup. There&#8217;s nothing to install per se, but there are standards for how to integrate them into your work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your identity powers IndieWeb. In other words, your site establishes your identity and can be used to do lots of things, like:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Notify other IndieWeb-supported sites when they are mentioned</li><li>Receive notifications from other IndieWeb sites when you are mentioned</li><li>Fetch information from a mention and format it for display</li><li>Authenticate your identity through your own website (a là a Google sign-in button but connected to your site)</li><li>&#8230;among other things.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If that sorta sounds like pingbacks, well, it sorta is. But much more robust and maintained.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>It&#8217;s different (and perhaps easier) to implement IndieWeb features on WordPress than it is a static site.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The big difference is that WordPress provides a lot of the requirements needed to do IndieWeb-y things. I like how David explains it:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The IndieWeb implementation on WordPress is a [series] of building blocks that you can or cannot choose to use, which is what makes it wonderful, but sometimes confusing. WordPress has a philosophy of decisions, not options. But the IndieWeb is all about options…about building the features that are right for you.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Those building blocks are plugins that you install to add IndieWeb protocols and technologies to WordPress. It&#8217;s awesome those are readily available because that takes a a lot of the work out of things. Running a static site, though, you&#8217;re on the hook for establishing most of that yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David&#8217;s post is 100% focused on the WordPress implementation. Your mileage may vary, but you will certainly walk away with a better idea of what protocols are available and how they fit together after reading his post — and hopefully this one as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The IndieWeb WordPress plugin establishes your identity.</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"332\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/banner-1544x500-1.png?resize=1024%2C332&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-366396\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/banner-1544x500-1.png?resize=1024%2C332&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/banner-1544x500-1.png?resize=300%2C97&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/banner-1544x500-1.png?resize=768%2C249&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/banner-1544x500-1.png?resize=1536%2C497&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/banner-1544x500-1.png?w=1544&amp;ssl=1 1544w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I thought it was doing so much stuff behind the scenes, but it&#8217;s a lot more simple than that:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The plugin by itself handles establishing your identity as the IndieWeb sees it.

The convenience here is that you get a handy little template that&#8217;s marked up to support the <a href=\"https://microformats.org/wiki/h-card\" rel=\"noopener\"><code>h-card</code> open format</a> and a widget to drop it into a theme&#8217;s widget area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a super detailed example of the <code>h-card</code> markup pulled from the <a href=\"https://microformats.org/wiki/h-card#Example\" rel=\"noopener\">documentation for Microformats2</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"HTML\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">&lt;div class=\"h-card\">\n  &lt;img class=\"u-photo\" alt=\"photo of Mitchell\"\n       src=\"https://webfwd.org/content/about-experts/300.mitchellbaker/mentor_mbaker.jpg\"/>\n  &lt;a class=\"p-name u-url\"\n     href=\"http://blog.lizardwrangler.com/\" \n    >Mitchell Baker&lt;/a>\n (&lt;a class=\"u-url\" \n     href=\"https://twitter.com/MitchellBaker\"\n    >@MitchellBaker&lt;/a>)\n  &lt;span class=\"p-org\">Mozilla Foundation&lt;/span>\n  &lt;p class=\"p-note\">\n    Mitchell is responsible for setting the direction and scope of the Mozilla Foundation and its activities.\n  &lt;/p>\n  &lt;span class=\"p-category\">Strategy&lt;/span>\n  &lt;span class=\"p-category\">Leadership&lt;/span>\n&lt;/div></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>See those class names? Classes like <code>.h-card</code>, <code>u-photo</code>, <code>p-name</code>, etc. all provide contextual meaning for a person&#8217;s identity which it then parsed as JSON:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"JSON\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">{\n  \"items\": [{ \n    \"type\": [\"h-card\"],\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"photo\": [\"https://webfwd.org/content/about-experts/300.mitchellbaker/mentor_mbaker.jpg\"],\n      \"name\": [\"Mitchell Baker\"],\n      \"url\": [\n        \"http://blog.lizardwrangler.com/\",\n        \"https://twitter.com/MitchellBaker\"\n      ],\n      \"org\": [\"Mozilla Foundation\"],\n      \"note\": [\"Mitchell is responsible for setting the direction and scope of the Mozilla Foundation and its activities.\"],\n      \"category\": [\n        \"Strategy\",\n        \"Leadership\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }]\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin isn&#8217;t doing the sending, receiving, or parsing. Instead, it provides a WordPress site with a way to verify your identity in the markup.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Not all WordPress themes support Microformats</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1544\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/banner-1544x500-1-1.png?resize=1544%2C500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-366397\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/banner-1544x500-1-1.png?w=1544&amp;ssl=1 1544w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/banner-1544x500-1-1.png?resize=300%2C97&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/banner-1544x500-1-1.png?resize=1024%2C332&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/banner-1544x500-1-1.png?resize=768%2C249&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/banner-1544x500-1-1.png?resize=1536%2C497&amp;ssl=1 1536w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you scratched your head first time you saw &#8220;Microformats&#8221; like I did, David defines it nicely:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>[&#8230;] Microformats…a way of marking up HTML to allow elements to be identified.

In other words, when another site mentions you — called a Webmention — the site mentioning you needs a way to support sending that mention to you, and your site needs a way to accept it (or vice versa).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s what the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/webmention/\" rel=\"noopener\">Webmention plugin</a> is for. It&#8217;s also probably the source of most of my IndieWeb confusion. I thought it was formatting data and needed an additional service to send and receive it. Nope! It&#8217;s actually sending and receiving the data rather than creating the mention. Back to David:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Back when it was built, the plugin handled only the business of receiving and sending webmentions, not handling display to any degree. Semantic Linkbacks, a separate plugin handled that for not only webmentions, but the older pingback and trackback protocols.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the Webmention plugin is communicating notifications. Meanwhile, another plugin called Semantic Linkbacks is what handles the data. And what the heck are Semantic Linkbacks?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Semantic Linkbacks fetch and handle data.</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"772\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/banner-772x250-1.png?resize=772%2C250&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-366402\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/banner-772x250-1.png?w=772&amp;ssl=1 772w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/banner-772x250-1.png?resize=300%2C97&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/banner-772x250-1.png?resize=768%2C249&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/semantic-linkbacks/\" rel=\"noopener\">Semantic Linkbacks</a> is another plugin that handles another piece of the process. There&#8217;s no way I can explain it better than David already does:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Semantic Linkbacks takes a webmention, which is a notification that another site has linked to something on your site, fetches the other site, and tries to render a display of the information. How that is done can vary from just a profile photo (if it can find one), to interpreting it as a full comment.</p><p>It does this using Microformats.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I expected that the main IndieWeb plugin was already doing this since it handles other markup. But it only provides the template and widget to get your identity on your site. Once the Semantic Linkbacks plugin fetches an incoming webmention, it takes the data, formats it, then attempts to display it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sounds like the plugin will be somewhat merged with (or replaced by) an upcoming version of the Webmention plugin:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Since many people are not inclined, or not comfortable modifying a theme, the new version of Webmentions will include several different alternative ways to try to find an image or summary to display…from OpenGraph (which Facebook and Twitter use to display URLs provided to it) to detecting the WordPress REST API version of a page and using that to get the author name and profile image. None of them will provided as much context as Microformats, but the experience will still be something worth installing.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s certainly nice as it taps into the WordPress REST API for the JSON response and formats that for display.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Brid.gy is a service to help display interactions.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A Webmention can be an interaction, say someone likes your post on Twitter or retweets it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1690\" height=\"998\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/webmentions-likes.png?resize=1690%2C998&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-366405\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/webmentions-likes.png?w=1690&amp;ssl=1 1690w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/webmentions-likes.png?resize=300%2C177&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/webmentions-likes.png?resize=1024%2C605&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/webmentions-likes.png?resize=768%2C454&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/webmentions-likes.png?resize=1536%2C907&amp;ssl=1 1536w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Differentiating a like from a repost from a comment from a whatever needs to happen, and you&#8217;d need to implement the Twitter (or whatever) API to draw those distinctions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s something you can certainly do!

      "content_text": "Well, sheesh. I opened a little can of worms when sharing Miriam’s “Am I on the IndieWeb yet?” with a short post bemoaning my own trouble getting on the IndieWeb train. But it’s a good can of worms.\n\n\n\nI think it was something like the next day after publishing that short post that David Shanske reached out and offered to help wrap my head around IndieWeb and the components that it comprises. And gosh dang if it wasn’t ridiculously helpful! So much so that I’d like to link you up to a new post David wrote after we talked, then summarize things here as best as I can because (1) it’s helpful to write things down and (2) have a reference for later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, IndieWeb is confusing.\n\n\n\nDavid had actually helped someone get their WordPress site all set up with IndieWeb powers. That person, too, was struggling to understand how the various pieces fit together. So, David already had this top of mind when Miriam and I were writing.\n\n\n\n“IndieWeb” is a new term for many folks and that’s where a lot of confusion breeds. Is it a framework? A philosophy? A set of standards? Depending on which one it is, the expectations shift as far as what it looks like to be a part of it.\n\n\n\nIt’s sort of all of the above. And that needs to be solidified a bit. There’s nothing inherently confusing about IndieWeb itself once you view it through those different lenses. After reading David’s post my understanding is that IndieWeb is more of a set of protocols. Sorta like working with structured data or OpenGraph in markup. There’s nothing to install per se, but there are standards for how to integrate them into your work.\n\n\n\nYour identity powers IndieWeb. In other words, your site establishes your identity and can be used to do lots of things, like:\n\n\n\nNotify other IndieWeb-supported sites when they are mentionedReceive notifications from other IndieWeb sites when you are mentionedFetch information from a mention and format it for displayAuthenticate your identity through your own website (a là a Google sign-in button but connected to your site)…among other things.\n\n\n\nIf that sorta sounds like pingbacks, well, it sorta is. But much more robust and maintained.\n\n\n\nIt’s different (and perhaps easier) to implement IndieWeb features on WordPress than it is a static site.\n\n\n\nThe big difference is that WordPress provides a lot of the requirements needed to do IndieWeb-y things. I like how David explains it:\n\n\n\nThe IndieWeb implementation on WordPress is a [series] of building blocks that you can or cannot choose to use, which is what makes it wonderful, but sometimes confusing. WordPress has a philosophy of decisions, not options. But the IndieWeb is all about options…about building the features that are right for you.\n\n\n\nThose building blocks are plugins that you install to add IndieWeb protocols and technologies to WordPress. It’s awesome those are readily available because that takes a a lot of the work out of things. Running a static site, though, you’re on the hook for establishing most of that yourself.\n\n\n\nDavid’s post is 100% focused on the WordPress implementation. Your mileage may vary, but you will certainly walk away with a better idea of what protocols are available and how they fit together after reading his post — and hopefully this one as well.\n\n\n\nThe IndieWeb WordPress plugin establishes your identity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI thought it was doing so much stuff behind the scenes, but it’s a lot more simple than that:\n\n\n\nThe plugin by itself handles establishing your identity as the IndieWeb sees it. It offers an h-card template and widget. H-Card is the markup for marking up information about a person or place. So, this is an element many people opt to put on their site anyway.\n\n\n\nSo, really, it’s possible to get the same sort of thing by correctly marking up a WordPress theme. The convenience here is that you get a handy little template that’s marked up to support the h-card open format and a widget to drop it into a theme’s widget area.\n\n\n\nHere’s a super detailed example of the h-card markup pulled from the documentation for Microformats2:\n\n\n\n<div class=\"h-card\">\n  <img class=\"u-photo\" alt=\"photo of Mitchell\"\n       src=\"https://webfwd.org/content/about-experts/300.mitchellbaker/mentor_mbaker.jpg\"/>\n  <a class=\"p-name u-url\"\n     href=\"http://blog.lizardwrangler.com/\" \n    >Mitchell Baker</a>\n (<a class=\"u-url\" \n     href=\"https://twitter.com/MitchellBaker\"\n    >@MitchellBaker</a>)\n  <span class=\"p-org\">Mozilla Foundation</span>\n  <p class=\"p-note\">\n    Mitchell is responsible for setting the direction and scope of the Mozilla Foundation and its activities.\n  </p>\n  <span class=\"p-category\">Strategy</span>\n  <span class=\"p-category\">Leadership</span>\n</div>\n\n\n\nSee those class names? Classes like .h-card, u-photo, p-name, etc. all provide contextual meaning for a person’s identity which it then parsed as JSON:\n\n\n\n{\n  \"items\": [{ \n    \"type\": [\"h-card\"],\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"photo\": [\"https://webfwd.org/content/about-experts/300.mitchellbaker/mentor_mbaker.jpg\"],\n      \"name\": [\"Mitchell Baker\"],\n      \"url\": [\n        \"http://blog.lizardwrangler.com/\",\n        \"https://twitter.com/MitchellBaker\"\n      ],\n      \"org\": [\"Mozilla Foundation\"],\n      \"note\": [\"Mitchell is responsible for setting the direction and scope of the Mozilla Foundation and its activities.\"],\n      \"category\": [\n        \"Strategy\",\n        \"Leadership\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }]\n}\n\n\n\nThe plugin isn’t doing the sending, receiving, or parsing. Instead, it provides a WordPress site with a way to verify your identity in the markup.\n\n\n\nNot all WordPress themes support Microformats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you scratched your head first time you saw “Microformats” like I did, David defines it nicely:\n\n\n\n[…] Microformats…a way of marking up HTML to allow elements to be identified. It is one of several ways of doing this, but is a very simple and readable one, which is why it is popular in the IndieWeb community.\n\n\n\nThe problem, as David continues, is that many themes aren’t marked up in a Microformats-friendly way — which is what the Microformats2 plugin is designed to fix.  That said, David is quick to call out that the plugin is extremely limited in how it accomplishes this, and he recommends instead marking up a theme by hand.\n\n\n\nAccording to David, the next major release of the Webmention plugin will likely include smarter ways of detecting content and images it can use and formatting them for Microformats2 support.\n\n\n\nWebmentions send and receive notifications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOK, so if you’ve established your identity through your site so you are discoverable, and your site is marked up for h-card support using Microformats2. Great! You still need something in the middle working as an operator that sends and receives notifications. In other words, when another site mentions you — called a Webmention — the site mentioning you needs a way to support sending that mention to you, and your site needs a way to accept it (or vice versa).\n\n\n\nThat’s what the Webmention plugin is for. It’s also probably the source of most of my IndieWeb confusion. I thought it was formatting data and needed an additional service to send and receive it. Nope!

      "content_text": "A diagram is a graphical representation of information that depicts the structure, relationship, or operation of anything. Diagrams enable your audience to visually grasp hidden information and engage with them in ways that words alone cannot. Depending on the type of project, there are numerous ways to use diagrams.

And, of course, there are <em>lots</em> of techniques and approaches to make them — no need to <a href=\"https://codepen.io/collection/KLDEaD\" rel=\"noopener\">look further than CodePen</a> to see just how many. In this article, though, we will see how to make a single element loader writing as little code as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-366266\"></span>\n\n\n\n<p>I have <a href=\"https://dev.to/afif/i-made-100-css-loaders-for-your-next-project-4eje\" rel=\"noopener\">made a collection of more than 500 single div loaders</a> and in this four-part series, I am going to share the tricks I used to create many of them. We will cover a huge number of examples, showing how small adjustments can lead to fun variations, and how little code we need to write to make it all happen!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-55 wp-block-group ticss-c35bb282\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h4 id=\"h-advanced-git-series\">Single-Element Loaders series:</h4>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Single Element Loaders: The Spinner — <em>you are here</em></li><li><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/single-element-loaders-the-dots/\">Single Element Loaders: The Dots</a></li><li><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/single-element-loaders-the-bars/\">Single Element Loaders: The Bars</a></li><li><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/single-element-loaders-going-3d/\">Single Element Loaders: Going 3D</a></li></ol>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>For this first article, we are going to create a one of the more common loader patterns: spinning bars:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_rNpbMvM\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/rNpbMvM?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=rNpbMvM&amp;default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed rNpbMvM\" title=\"CodePen Embed rNpbMvM\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Here’s the approach</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A trivial implementation for this loader is to create one element for each bar wrapped inside a parent element (for nine total elements), then play with <code>opacity</code> and <code>transform</code> to get the spinning effect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My implementation, though, requires only one element:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"HTML\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">&lt;div class=\"loader\">&lt;/div></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;and 10 CSS declarations:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.loader {\n  width: 150px; /* control the size */\n  aspect-ratio: 1;\n  display: grid;\n  mask: conic-gradient(from 22deg, #0003, #000);\n  animation: load 1s steps(8) infinite;\n}\n.loader,\n.loader:before {\n  --_g: linear-gradient(#17177c 0 0) 50%; /* update the color here */\n  background: \n    var(--_g)/34% 8%  space no-repeat,\n    var(--_g)/8%  34% no-repeat space;\n}\n.loader:before {\n  content: \"\";\n  transform: rotate(45deg);\n}\n@keyframes load {\n  to { transform: rotate(1turn); }\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h3>Let’s break that down</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>At first glance, the code may look strange but you will see that it’s more simple than what you might think. The first step is to define the dimension of the element. In our case, it’s a <code>150px</code> square. We can put <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/a/aspect-ratio/\"><code>aspect-ratio</code></a> to use so the element stays square no matter what.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.loader {\n  width: 150px; /* control the size */\n  aspect-ratio: 1; /* make height equal to width */\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>When building CSS loaders, I always try to have one value for controlling the overall size. In this case, it’s the <code>width</code> and all the calculations we cover will refer to that value. This allows me to change a single value to control the loader. It’s always important to be able to easily adjust the size of our loaders without the need to adjust a lot of additional values.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, we will use gradients to create the bars. This is the trickiest part! Let’s use <em>one</em> gradient to create <em>two</em> bars like the below:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">background: linear-gradient(#17177c 0 0) 50%/34% 8% space no-repeat;</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"577\" height=\"340\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/s_98F21CD3C1C7899779F98C6C3E6075E37A8E660CF4703968B4D3A7A973FF0FA6_1651414613507_image.png?resize=577%2C340&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Showing a space between two gradient lines for a single element loader.\" class=\"wp-image-366269\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/s_98F21CD3C1C7899779F98C6C3E6075E37A8E660CF4703968B4D3A7A973FF0FA6_1651414613507_image.png?w=577&amp;ssl=1 577w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/s_98F21CD3C1C7899779F98C6C3E6075E37A8E660CF4703968B4D3A7A973FF0FA6_1651414613507_image.png?resize=300%2C177&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Our gradient is defined with one color and two color stops. The result is a solid color with no fading or transitions. The size is equal to <code>34%</code> wide and <code>8%</code> tall. It’s also placed in the center (<code>50%</code>). The trick is the use of the keyword value <code>space</code> — this duplicates the gradient, giving us two total bars.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#valdef-background-repeat-space\" rel=\"noopener\">the specification</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The image is repeated as often as will fit within the background positioning area without being clipped and then the images are spaced out to fill the area. The first and last images touch the edges of the area.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I am using a width equal to <code>34%</code> which means we cannot have more than two bars (<code>3*34%</code> is greater than <code>100%</code>) but with two bars we will have empty spaces (<code>100% - 2 * 34% = 32%</code>). That space is placed in the center between the two bars. In other words, we use a width for the gradient that is between <code>33%</code> and <code>50%</code> to make sure we have at least two bars with a little bit of space between them. The value <code>space</code> is what correctly places them for us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We do the same and make a second similar gradient to get two more bars at the top and bottom, which give us a <code>background</code> property value of:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">background: \n linear-gradient(#17177c 0 0) 50%/34% 8%  space no-repeat,\n linear-gradient(#17177c 0 0) 50%/8%  34% no-repeat space;</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>We can optimize that using a CSS variable to avoid repetition:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">--_g: linear-gradient(#17177c 0 0) 50%; /* update the color here */\nbackground: \n var(--_g)/34% 8%  space no-repeat,\n var(--_g)/8%  34% no-repeat space;</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>So, now we have four bars and, thanks to CSS variables, we can write the color value once which makes it easy to update later (like we did with the size of the loader).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To create the remaining bars, let’s tap into the <code>.loader</code> element and its <code>::before</code> pseudo-element to get four more bars for a grand total of eight in all.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.loader {\n  width: 150px; /* control the size */\n  aspect-ratio: 1;\n  display: grid;\n}\n.loader,\n.loader::before {\n  --_g: linear-gradient(#17177c 0 0) 50%; /* update the color here */\n  background: \n    var(--_g)/34% 8%  space no-repeat,\n    var(--_g)/8%  34% no-repeat space;\n}\n.loader::before {\n  content: \"\";\n  transform: rotate(45deg);\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Note the use of <code>display: grid</code>. This allows us to rely on the grid’s default <code>stretch</code> alignment to make the pseudo-element cover the whole area of its parent; thus there’s no need to specify a dimension on it — another trick that reduces the code and avoid us to deal with a lot of values!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now let’s rotate the pseudo-element by <code>45deg</code> to position the remaining bars. Hover the following demo to see the trick:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_QWQWQOV\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/QWQWQOV?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=QWQWQOV&amp;default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed QWQWQOV\" title=\"CodePen Embed QWQWQOV\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Setting opacity</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What we’re trying to do is create the impression that there is one bar that leaves a trail of fading bars behind it as it travels a circular path. What we need now is to play with the transparency of our bars to make that trail, which we are going to do with CSS <code>mask</code> combined with a conic-gradient as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">mask: conic-gradient(from 22deg,#0003,#000);</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>To better see the trick, let’s apply this to a full-colored box:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_LYQYQdZ\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/LYQYQdZ?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=LYQYQdZ&amp;default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed LYQYQdZ\" title=\"CodePen Embed LYQYQdZ\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The transparency of the red color is gradually increasing clockwise. We apply this to our loader and we have the bars with different opacity:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"827\" height=\"278\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/s_98F21CD3C1C7899779F98C6C3E6075E37A8E660CF4703968B4D3A7A973FF0FA6_1651416594508_image.png?resize=827%2C278&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Radial gradient plus, spinner bars equals spinner bars with gradients.\" class=\"wp-image-366270\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/s_98F21CD3C1C7899779F98C6C3E6075E37A8E660CF4703968B4D3A7A973FF0FA6_1651416594508_image.png?w=827&amp;ssl=1 827w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/s_98F21CD3C1C7899779F98C6C3E6075E37A8E660CF4703968B4D3A7A973FF0FA6_1651416594508_image.png?resize=300%2C101&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/s_98F21CD3C1C7899779F98C6C3E6075E37A8E660CF4703968B4D3A7A973FF0FA6_1651416594508_image.png?resize=768%2C258&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In reality, each bar appears to fade because it’s masked by a gradient and falls between two semi-transparent colors. It’s hardly noticeable when this runs, so it’s sort of like being able to say that all the bars have the same color with a different level of opacity.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The rotation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s apply a rotation animation to get our loader. Note, that we need a stepped animation and not a continuous one that’s why I am using <code>steps(8)</code>. <code>8</code> is nothing but the number of the bars, so that value can be changed depending on how many bars are in use.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.loader {\n  animation: load 3s steps(8) infinite;\n}\n\n/* Same as before: */\n@keyframes load {\n  to { transform: rotate(1turn) }\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_Yzezemr\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/Yzezemr?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=Yzezemr&amp;default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed Yzezemr\" title=\"CodePen Embed Yzezemr\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s it! We have our loader with only one element and a few lines of CSS. We can easily control its size and color by adjusting one value.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_zYRYWOq\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/zYRYWOq?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=zYRYWOq&amp;default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed zYRYWOq\" title=\"CodePen Embed zYRYWOq\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Since we only used the <code>::before</code> pseudo-element, we can add four more bars by using <code>::after</code> to end with 12 bars in total and almost the same code:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_QWQWmWP\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/QWQWmWP?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=QWQWmWP&amp;default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed QWQWmWP\" title=\"CodePen Embed QWQWmWP\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\n\n\n\n<p>We update the rotation of our pseudo-elements to consider <code>30deg</code> and <code>60deg</code> instead of <code>45deg</code> while using an twelve-step animation, rather than eight. I also decreased the height to <code>5%</code> instead of <code>8%</code> to make the bars a little thinner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notice, too, that we have <code>grid-area: 1/1</code> on the pseudo-elements. This allows us to place them in the same area as one another, stacked on top of each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Guess what? We can reach for the same loader using another implementation:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_OJQzbzr\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/OJQzbzr?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=OJQzbzr&amp;default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed OJQzbzr\" title=\"CodePen Embed OJQzbzr\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Can you figure out the logic behind the code? Here is a hint: the opacity is no longer handled with a CSS <code>mask</code> but inside the gradient and is also using the <code>opacity</code> property.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Why not dots instead?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We can totally do that:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_RwQyzmY\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/RwQyzmY?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=RwQyzmY&amp;default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed RwQyzmY\" title=\"CodePen Embed RwQyzmY\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\n\n\n\n<p>If you check the code, you will see that we’re now working with a radial gradient instead of a linear one. Otherwise, the concept is exactly the same where the mask creates the impression of opacity, but we made the shapes as circles instead of lines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below is a figure to illustrate the new gradient configuration:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"693\" height=\"293\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/s_B3DCAAF1BD4EF695C8E8E4733CA6E3BD909E614220F68B297B62285B12C652E5_1654551247592_image.png?resize=693%2C293&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Showing placement of dots in the single-element loader.\" class=\"wp-image-366271\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/s_B3DCAAF1BD4EF695C8E8E4733CA6E3BD909E614220F68B297B62285B12C652E5_1654551247592_image.png?w=693&amp;ssl=1 693w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/s_B3DCAAF1BD4EF695C8E8E4733CA6E3BD909E614220F68B297B62285B12C652E5_1654551247592_image.png?resize=300%2C127&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re using Safari, note that the demo may be buggy. That&#8217;s because Safari currently lacks support for the <code>at</code> syntax in radial gradients. But we can reconfigure the gradient a bit to overcome that:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"6,12\"><code markup=\"tt\">.loader,\n.loader:before,\n.loader:after {\n  background:\n    radial-gradient(\n      circle closest-side,\n      currentColor 90%,\n      #0000 98%\n    ) \n    50% -150%/20% 80% repeat-y,\n    radial-gradient(\n      circle closest-side,\n      currentColor 90%,\n      #0000 98%\n    ) \n    -150% 50%/80% 20% repeat-x;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_eYVLKOv/555436ef8e29838fff4872caa1dcf8d9\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/eYVLKOv/555436ef8e29838fff4872caa1dcf8d9?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=eYVLKOv/555436ef8e29838fff4872caa1dcf8d9&amp;default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed eYVLKOv/555436ef8e29838fff4872caa1dcf8d9\" title=\"CodePen Embed eYVLKOv/555436ef8e29838fff4872caa1dcf8d9\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>More loader examples</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is another idea for a spinner loader similar to the previous one.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_PoJyaNy\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/PoJyaNy?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=PoJyaNy&amp;default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed PoJyaNy\" title=\"CodePen Embed PoJyaNy\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\n\n\n\n<p>For this one, I am only relying on <code>background</code> and <code>mask</code> to create the shape (no pseudo-elements needed).

      "content_text": "Making CSS-only loaders is one of my favorite tasks. It’s always satisfying to look at those infinite animations. And, of course, there are lots of techniques and approaches to make them — no need to look further than CodePen to see just how many. In this article, though, we will see how to make a single element loader writing as little code as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have made a collection of more than 500 single div loaders and in this four-part series, I am going to share the tricks I used to create many of them. We will cover a huge number of examples, showing how small adjustments can lead to fun variations, and how little code we need to write to make it all happen!\n\n\n\n\nSingle-Element Loaders series:\n\n\n\nSingle Element Loaders: The Spinner — you are hereSingle Element Loaders: The DotsSingle Element Loaders: The BarsSingle Element Loaders: Going 3D\n\n\n\n\nFor this first article, we are going to create a one of the more common loader patterns: spinning bars:\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nHere’s the approach\n\n\n\nA trivial implementation for this loader is to create one element for each bar wrapped inside a parent element (for nine total elements), then play with opacity and transform to get the spinning effect.\n\n\n\nMy implementation, though, requires only one element:\n\n\n\n<div class=\"loader\"></div>\n\n\n\n…and 10 CSS declarations:\n\n\n\n.loader {\n  width: 150px; /* control the size */\n  aspect-ratio: 1;\n  display: grid;\n  mask: conic-gradient(from 22deg, #0003, #000);\n  animation: load 1s steps(8) infinite;\n}\n.loader,\n.loader:before {\n  --_g: linear-gradient(#17177c 0 0) 50%; /* update the color here */\n  background: \n    var(--_g)/34% 8%  space no-repeat,\n    var(--_g)/8%  34% no-repeat space;\n}\n.loader:before {\n  content: \"\";\n  transform: rotate(45deg);\n}\n@keyframes load {\n  to { transform: rotate(1turn); }\n}\n\n\n\nLet’s break that down\n\n\n\nAt first glance, the code may look strange but you will see that it’s more simple than what you might think. The first step is to define the dimension of the element. In our case, it’s a 150px square. We can put aspect-ratio to use so the element stays square no matter what.\n\n\n\n.loader {\n  width: 150px; /* control the size */\n  aspect-ratio: 1; /* make height equal to width */\n}\n\n\n\nWhen building CSS loaders, I always try to have one value for controlling the overall size. In this case, it’s the width and all the calculations we cover will refer to that value. This allows me to change a single value to control the loader. It’s always important to be able to easily adjust the size of our loaders without the need to adjust a lot of additional values.\n\n\n\nNext, we will use gradients to create the bars. This is the trickiest part! Let’s use one gradient to create two bars like the below:\n\n\n\nbackground: linear-gradient(#17177c 0 0) 50%/34% 8% space no-repeat;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur gradient is defined with one color and two color stops. The result is a solid color with no fading or transitions. The size is equal to 34% wide and 8% tall. It’s also placed in the center (50%). The trick is the use of the keyword value space — this duplicates the gradient, giving us two total bars.\n\n\n\nFrom the specification:\n\n\n\nThe image is repeated as often as will fit within the background positioning area without being clipped and then the images are spaced out to fill the area. The first and last images touch the edges of the area.\n\n\n\nI am using a width equal to 34% which means we cannot have more than two bars (3*34% is greater than 100%) but with two bars we will have empty spaces (100% - 2 * 34% = 32%). That space is placed in the center between the two bars. In other words, we use a width for the gradient that is between 33% and 50% to make sure we have at least two bars with a little bit of space between them. The value space is what correctly places them for us.\n\n\n\nWe do the same and make a second similar gradient to get two more bars at the top and bottom, which give us a background property value of:\n\n\n\nbackground: \n linear-gradient(#17177c 0 0) 50%/34% 8%  space no-repeat,\n linear-gradient(#17177c 0 0) 50%/8%  34% no-repeat space;\n\n\n\nWe can optimize that using a CSS variable to avoid repetition:\n\n\n\n--_g: linear-gradient(#17177c 0 0) 50%; /* update the color here */\nbackground: \n var(--_g)/34% 8%  space no-repeat,\n var(--_g)/8%  34% no-repeat space;\n\n\n\nSo, now we have four bars and, thanks to CSS variables, we can write the color value once which makes it easy to update later (like we did with the size of the loader).\n\n\n\nTo create the remaining bars, let’s tap into the .loader element and its ::before pseudo-element to get four more bars for a grand total of eight in all.\n\n\n\n.loader {\n  width: 150px; /* control the size */\n  aspect-ratio: 1;\n  display: grid;\n}\n.loader,\n.loader::before {\n  --_g: linear-gradient(#17177c 0 0) 50%; /* update the color here */\n  background: \n    var(--_g)/34% 8%  space no-repeat,\n    var(--_g)/8%  34% no-repeat space;\n}\n.loader::before {\n  content: \"\";\n  transform: rotate(45deg);\n}\n\n\n\nNote the use of display: grid. This allows us to rely on the grid’s default stretch alignment to make the pseudo-element cover the whole area of its parent; thus there’s no need to specify a dimension on it — another trick that reduces the code and avoid us to deal with a lot of values!\n\n\n\nNow let’s rotate the pseudo-element by 45deg to position the remaining bars. Hover the following demo to see the trick:\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nSetting opacity\n\n\n\nWhat we’re trying to do is create the impression that there is one bar that leaves a trail of fading bars behind it as it travels a circular path. What we need now is to play with the transparency of our bars to make that trail, which we are going to do with CSS mask combined with a conic-gradient as follows:\n\n\n\nmask: conic-gradient(from 22deg,#0003,#000);\n\n\n\nTo better see the trick, let’s apply this to a full-colored box:\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nThe transparency of the red color is gradually increasing clockwise. We apply this to our loader and we have the bars with different opacity:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn reality, each bar appears to fade because it’s masked by a gradient and falls between two semi-transparent colors. It’s hardly noticeable when this runs, so it’s sort of like being able to say that all the bars have the same color with a different level of opacity.\n\n\n\nThe rotation\n\n\n\nLet’s apply a rotation animation to get our loader. Note, that we need a stepped animation and not a continuous one that’s why I am using steps(8). 8 is nothing but the number of the bars, so that value can be changed depending on how many bars are in use.\n\n\n\n.loader {\n  animation: load 3s steps(8) infinite;\n}\n\n/* Same as before: */\n@keyframes load {\n  to { transform: rotate(1turn) }\n}\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nThat’s it! We have our loader with only one element and a few lines of CSS. We can easily control its size and color by adjusting one value.\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nSince we only used the ::before pseudo-element, we can add four more bars by using ::after to end with 12 bars in total and almost the same code:\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nWe update the rotation of our pseudo-elements to consider 30deg and 60deg instead of 45deg while using an twelve-step animation, rather than eight. I also decreased the height to 5% instead of 8% to make the bars a little thinner.\n\n\n\nNotice, too, that we have grid-area: 1/1 on the pseudo-elements. This allows us to place them in the same area as one another, stacked on top of each other.\n\n\n\nGuess what? We can reach for the same loader using another implementation:\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nCan you figure out the logic behind the code? Here is a hint: the opacity is no longer handled with a CSS mask but inside the gradient and is also using the opacity property.\n\n\n\nWhy not dots instead?\n\n\n\nWe can totally do that:\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nIf you check the code, you will see that we’re now working with a radial gradient instead of a linear one. Otherwise, the concept is exactly the same where the mask creates the impression of opacity, but we made the shapes as circles instead of lines.\n\n\n\nBelow is a figure to illustrate the new gradient configuration:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re using Safari, note that the demo may be buggy. That’s because Safari currently lacks support for the at syntax in radial gradients. But we can reconfigure the gradient a bit to overcome that:\n\n\n\n.loader,\n.loader:before,\n.loader:after {\n  background:\n    radial-gradient(\n      circle closest-side,\n      currentColor 90%,\n      #0000 98%\n    ) \n    50% -150%/20% 80% repeat-y,\n    radial-gradient(\n      circle closest-side,\n      currentColor 90%,\n      #0000 98%\n    ) \n    -150% 50%/80% 20% repeat-x;\n}\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nMore loader examples\n\n\n\nHere is another idea for a spinner loader similar to the previous one.\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nFor this one, I am only relying on background and mask to create the shape (no pseudo-elements needed). I am also defining the configuration with CSS variables to be able to create a lot of variations from the same code — another example of just the powers of CSS variables. I wrote another article about this technique if you want to more details.\n\n\n\nNote that some browsers still rely on a -webkit- prefix for mask-composite with its own set of values, and will not display the spinner in the demo. Here is a way to do it without mast-composite for more browser support.\n\n\n\nI have another one for you:\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nFor this one, I am using a background-color to control the color, and use mask and mask-composite to create the final shape:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we end, here are some more spinning loaders I made a while back. I am relying on different techniques but still using gradients, masks, pseudo-element, etc. It could be a good exercise to figure out the logic of each one and learn new tricks at the same time. This said, if you have any question about them, the comment section is down below.\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nCodePen Embed Fallback\n\n\n\nWrapping up\n\n\n\nSee, there’s so much we can do in CSS with nothing but a single div, a couple of gradients, pseudo-elements, variables. It seems like we created a whole bunch of different spinning loaders, but they’re all basically the same thing with slight modifications.\n\n\n\nThis is only the the beginning. In this series, we will be looking at more ideas and advanced concepts for creating CSS loaders.\n\n\n\n\nSingle-Element Loaders series:\n\n\n\nSingle Element Loaders: The Spinner — you are hereSingle Element Loaders: The DotsSingle Element Loaders: The BarsSingle Element Loaders: Going 3D\n\n\nSingle Element Loaders: The Spinner originally published on CSS-Tricks.
